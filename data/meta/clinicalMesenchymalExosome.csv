",      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of mesenchymal stromal      cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA (iExosomes) in treating participants with      pancreatic cancer with KrasG12D mutation that has spread to other places in the body.      iExosomes may work better at treating pancreatic cancer.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived      exosomes loaded with small interference RNA (siRNA) against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with KrasG12D mutation.      II. To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived      exosomes loaded with siRNA against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic PDAC patients with      KrasG12D mutation.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of iExosomes. II. Assess the overall response rate of      iExosomes in the chosen patient population.      III. Assess the disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) with therapy.      IV. Determine median progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment. V. Determine the      median overall survival (OS) with this treatment.      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:      I. Evaluate optional tissue collection and serum-derived exosomes and circulating-free      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) for detection of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) showing      KrasG12D sequence; evaluate DNA and RNA showing KrasG12D sequence in optional tissue      collection.      II. Evaluate the siRNA content in blood and optional tissue collection.      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.      Participants receive mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA      intravenously (IV) over 15-20 minutes on days 1, 4, and 10. Treatment repeats every 14 days      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.      Participants who respond may continue 3 additional courses.      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 3      months for up to 1 year.    ",,"

",      Evaluate the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment with pulmonary infection caused by      gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems.    ,"      Pulmonary infection is a critical disease threatening human health. With the extensive use of      antibiotics, the incidence of clinical drug resistance has been on the rise significantly in      recent years. Once drug resistance occurs, we will see a high mortality rate due to scarce      therapies and a poor prognosis. It is almost impossible to surmount the severe pulmonary      infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria only by upgrading antibiotics. The commonly used      supportive therapies clinically, such as glucocorticoids and immunomodulators, also lack      forceful medical evidence. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new treatments.      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.      Currently, it has been confirmed that stem cells can visibly improve the pathological changes      of lungs caused by infection, lighten pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, mitigate      alveolar inflammation, and remove bacteria. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of      pulmonary infection caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria.      Patients were treated, in the research project, with well-suited noninvasive haMPC-Exos      aerosol inhalation, in an attempt to verify the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment      with pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems.

",      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Umbilical Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UMSCs)      derived Exosomes could alleviate dry eye symptoms in patients with chronic Graft Versus Host      Diseases (cGVHD).    ,"      Among patients with cGVHD, 60% - 90% are affected by dry eye symptoms, presenting as      progressive development of dryness, foreign body sensation, photophobia, pain and even      blindness, which seriously affect their life quality. At present, the standard first-line      treatment of cGVHD is still hormone or combined with immunosuppressant of cyclosporine. The      dry eyes related to cGVHD are treated with artificial tears, lacrimal punctum embolization,      local immunosuppressant or even blepharoplasty to reduce dry eye symptoms. Although a variety      of new immunosuppressants and monoclonal antibodies have been used in clinic, the overall      efficacy is still unsatisfactory with apparent side effects, and the period of treatment is      long with high-costs. Therefore, it is an urgent task for clinicians to explore new methods      of cGVHD related dry eye therapy and improve the survival rate and quality of life of      patients.      Exosomes are a kind of membrane vesicles secreted by parental cells, which can mediate the      transfer of RNA, protein, DNA and other functional molecules between cells and regulate the      function of target cells. The therapeutic potential of UMSC exosomes has been widely studied      in diseases of liver, kidney, skin and so on. Previously, we found that UMSC exosomes can      significantly alleviate the symptoms of dry eye in the dry eye animal model. At present, we      plan to clarify its efficacy in clinical research.      The main objective of this study is to assess the alleviation of dry eye symptoms in patients      with cGVHD after UMSC-exo treatment by measuring Ocular Surface Index Score (OSDI), and the      second objective include the measurement of tear secretion amount, tear break time, the areas      stained by fluorescent, ocular redness, tear meniscus and best corrected visual acuity.      Approximately 27 study subjects will be recruited. The treatment group will receive      artificial tears for 2 weeks to normalize the baseline, followed by intervention of UMSC-exo      10ug/drop, four times a day for 14 days. The follow-up visit will be 12-week, progression of      dry eye will be measured.    ",,"

",      To evaluate allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (hMSC-Exos) in the treatment of      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)    ,"      According to the 2012 Berlin diagnostic criteria, there are currently more than 3 million      ARDS patients worldwide, accounting for about 10% of patients in the intensive care unit      (ICU). In recent years, the incidence of ARDS has increased significantly, which has      significantly increased the social and economic burden. The impact of ARDS can even be      compared with tumors, AIDS or myocardial infarction. There are the basic clinical treatments,      such as using various ventilation methods to improve hypoxia and choosing alternative      therapies to improve renal insufficiency. Therefore, there is still a lack of specific      treatment measures.      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes.      Studies have confirmed that MSC-Exos can improve most of the pathological changes caused by      lung infection, reduce pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, reduce alveolar      inflammation, and clear bacterial infections. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of      ARDS.

","      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infectious disease characterized by acute respiratory      impairment due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in      Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available      for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with      mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly      recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such      as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot      clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation      of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe      patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).    ","      Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event,      especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over      10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral      treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are      recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such      as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality      of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to      patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute      respiratory impairment.      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes      (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from      different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and      outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on      inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.      Although human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and      septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs.      The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured      microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by      treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility      of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed      therapeutic use.      The purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial,      therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes      derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe      patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).

","      Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) after surgical repaired for acute type A aortic      dissection (ATAAD) is a life-threatening condition. In this study, patients who undergoing      surgical repaired of ATAAD immediately or presenting sever MODS after surgical repaired of      acute type A aortic dissection will be treated with umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem      cell.    ","      Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) are common debilitating complications after      surgical repaired for ATAAD. MODS is one of the chief causes of post-operative death for      acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD) patients, and it was reported that MODS accounted for      more than half of the death after surgery for ATAAD. Despite recent advance in surgical      technique, mortality rate remains high in such critical care conditions. In animal models,      studies have demonstrated the beneficial effects of MSCs with respect to ischemia-reperfusion      injury of heart, lungs, kidney, brains and livers. Several pilot studies have provided      evidence that MSC may be effective in treating critically ill patients with traumatic brain      injury, acute renal failure, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. There is increasing      evidence that MSCs function in a paracrine manner. Exosomes have been reported to activate      signaling pathways by binding to receptors. Compared with mesenchymal stem cells, exosomes      are more stable and storable and no risk of aneuploidy. The possibility of immune rejection      after allogeneic administration of exosomes is lower and can provide alternative treatment      for a variety of diseases.      The trial contains two parts:      Part one (prevention scheme):to explore the safety and efficacy of exosome of MSC, the      investigators will recruit patients who are diagnosed with ATAAD, and 15 participants will be      administrated intravenously with exosome of MSC immediately after ascending aortic      replacement combined with open placement of triple branched stent graft while other 15 not.      Then the investigators will monitor participants' MODS related biochemical indexes,      sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, comparing to those don't be treated with      exosome of MSC.      Phase two (treatment scheme): for patients presenting severe MODS (SOFA score≥10) after      ascending aortic replacement combined with open placement of triple-branched stent graft, the      investigators will randomly use exosome of MSC to 15 of participants while other 15 not. Then      the investigators will monitor participants' MODS related biochemical indexes, SOFA scores,      comparing to those don't be treated with MSC. The dosage of the exosome of MSC was determined      on the basis of the previous clinical studies, which is 180mg once a time and administrated      intravenously.    ",,"

","      At present, a number of projects related to MSCs have been approved for graft-versus-host      disease, myocardial infarction, Crohn's disease and other diseases, indicating a strong      therapeutic potential of MSCs. However, the efficacy of MSC-Exo for severely infected      children is not fully evaluated. In our study, patients who met the inclusion criteria will      be divided into trial group and control group. Clinical and demographic data, as well as      treatment outcome will be collected from the electronic health record. This study will      evaluate the application and therapeutic effect of MSC-Exo in severely infected children, and      determine the Optimal dosage and infusion.    ","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with high self-renewal ability and      multidirectional differentiation potential. studies revealed that local or systemic      administration of mesenchymal stem cell-derivrd exosomes (MSC-Exo) efficiently suppressed      detrimental immune response in inflamed tissues and promoted survival and regeneration of      injured parenchymal cells. European Union countries have written MSCs into treatment      guidelines for refractory graft-versus-host disease.      In China, the technology for isolation, in vitro culture and expansion of MSCs is already      mature. With further research on the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-Exo and the development of      clinical trials, it is expected to become a treatment for severe illness.      A predictable infection plan is going to be widely used in clinics to provide individualized      treatment for patients, improve the prognosis of patients and improve the quality of life.      The investigators intend to enroll all children who were hospitalized in pediatric intensive      care unit PICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2022 to December 2023.      Children with a PICU length of day less than 48h will be excluded.    ",,"

","The death rate of childrenwithin 28 days after they discharged from PICUThe death rate of children in 28 days after their discharged from PICU, Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction ScoreWithin 3 to 15 days after the start of treatmentThe Marshall Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score (MODS) assesses the same six organ systems using slightly different values for four grades of organ dysfunction. The total score, ranging from 0 to 24, arises from the sum of all single organ scores using the first measured value of the day. Intervals for the most abnormal value of each variable were constructed on a scale from 0 to 4 so that a value of 0 represented essentially normal function and was associated with an ICU mortality rate of < 5%, whereas a value of 4 represented marked functional derangement and an ICU mortality rate of > or = 50%., the age, PaO2/FlO2, and plateau pressure score (APPS)Within 3 to 15 days after the start of treatmentThe APPS is a 9-point score that is calculated by measuring the age, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and plateau pressure at 24 h after the patient is diagnosed with moderate to severe ARDS and counting each one to 1-3. Since many variables are not needed for calculations, clinicians can easily predict the in-hospital mortality of mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS patients at bedside.","

","      Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are both      associated with the prevailing upper respiratory tract infections caused by the      RNA-containing SARS-CoV2 virus of the genius Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. As      both the viral infiltration and infection progress, the host immune system response can be      one of a rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm. In the ARDS or NCP ensuing progression, the      patient often succumbs to the effects of the hyper pro-inflammatory response, hence      contributing to the associated increased mortality as a result of the cytokine storm and      associated pathogenesis.    ","      In December of 2019, in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus outbreak began. Globally this      disease referred to as COVID-19, is the result of a novel SARS-CoV2 virus which predominantly      targets Type II lung alveolar cells (AT2). The hyper response of the host immune system can      rapidly evolve into a life-threatening cytokine-release syndrome or cytokine storm. The      cytokine storm can predispose the patient to ARDS and/or NCP., or both. Left unchecked, the      ARDS pathogenesis rapidly culminates in disruption of cell cytotoxicity mechanisms, excessive      activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and a predominance of type I (M1) macrophage; resulting      in the massive release of a host of proinflammatory cytokines (FNO-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,      IL-10), granulocytic colony-stimulating factor, monocytic chemoattractive protein 1. The      result systemically is a rise in surrogate inflammatory markers (C Reactive Protein, serum      ferritin), with a corresponding infiltration of internal organs and tissues by activated      macrophage, T-lymphocytes and a predominance of cellular apoptosis. The resulting      hyperinflammatory pathogenic reaction may result in severe aveolar lesions leading to death,      scarring, or severe lung damage, persisting well after discharge.      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-culutre      media (MSC-CM) may significantly reduce the pro-inflammatory bias and associated pathologic      impairment resulting. The MSC-CM, known to contain exosomes, has been shown to have an      anti-inflammatory effect. Further exosomes associated with the amniotic membrane, long used      in the treatment of burn and wounds, have been show to have a regenerative effect.      The purpose of this protocol is to explore the safety and efficacy of an intravenous      injection of MSC derived exosomes in the treatment of severe patients (moderate to severe      Berlin score) with ARDS or NCP.

","      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: AGLE-102 is an allogeneic derived extracellular vesicle (EV) product      derived from normal donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).      INDICATION AND RATIONALE: The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of      AGLE-102 in the treatment of lesions in subjects with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.    ","      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.      Eligible subjects will undergo a one-month observation period to confirm that the targeted      wound is chronic (only single wounds with evidence of less than 20% closure over that period      will be eligible for treatment). Once this has been established, up to 6 administrations of      BM-MSC EVs will occur, at each to be given over a period of no more than 3 months. A maximum      of 50 cm2 in total wound surface will be treated, and each administration will occur 14 days      (+/- 7 days) but no less than 7 days apart. If the wound closes prior to 6 administrations,      no additional doses will be given. Wound closure will be determined by complete      re-epithelialization that is not subject to re-injury during dressing changes or as a result      of normal daily activities (e.g. wearing clothing, eating, sleeping). After the 6 doses of      BM-MSC EVs are given, the wound will be followed monthly for a period of 4 months to the      termination of the study at 8 months or, in the event the wound closes before receiving all 6      doses, for 4 month after the wound closes. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarTM will be used to measure      the target lesion at all visits.      STUDY OBJECTIVES:      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the safety of applying single      administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds      between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine the safety of applying      multiple administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to      DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month and to determine      if there is clinical benefit (>50% closure) of applying BM-MSC EVs to DEB wounds      PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: 10 subjects will be treated on the protocol with AGLE-102.

","      This study aims to evaluate bone formation in grafts in terms of its quality (density),      quantity (volume) and maturation obtained with the application of a tissue-engineered bone      grafting compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-culture medium (CM) and a synthetic      bone substitute. The present study was designed as an experimental prospective split-mouth      randomized controlled clinical trial. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics      Committee, a total of 20 consecutive participants in need of maxillary reconstruction aiming      implant-supported oral rehabilitation will be invited to join the study. To collect      autogenous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs), an outpatient lipoplasty      procedure at the abdominal area of each patient will be performed. To isolate and expand      hASCs from the lipoaspirate, specific cell culture protocols will be followed, resulting in      cultured viable cells and their conditioned medium (CM). Cells and CM will be then separated      by a sequence of filters and centrifugation, and isolated CM will be frozen. ELISA will      analyze the presence of chemokines and their concentration in CM before grafting. Following      pre-op surgical planning, both maxillary sinuses of each patient will be grafted internally      applying a lateral window to each sinus. The bony floor of the test maxillary sinus will be      augmented with synthetic bone substitute (BoneCeramic™ 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM      (test). The control site will receive bone substitute with saline. Lateral windows in both      sinuses will be then closed with a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide™). After 6 months, first-stage      implant surgery will be performed placing 6 implants in each patient. Registration of implant      stability by manual torque wrench will be performed. Also, bone biopsies from each drilled      implant site will be collected for histology, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry      (RT-PCR). Tomographic evaluation of the bone formation will include cone beam computed      tomographies (CBCTs) at pre-operative [Baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2 = implant placement]      days for bone 3D image analysis.    ","      1. Aims and Hypothesis           Based in previously reported studies and following a translational approach, a           hypothesis that the paracrine effect linked to cultured autogenous growth factors and           cytokines at physiologic concentrations acting locally in grafted sites might promote a           faster and/or more efficient cell response and consequently induce a more           significant/faster bone formation was considered. The presence of these molecules added           to synthetic bone substitutes might act positively in terms of local cell recruitment           (chemotaxis), proliferation, differentiation and bone protein synthesis. Also, recurrent           biological hazards involved in conventional tissue-engineered cellular graft compounds,           usually linked to the ex vivo manipulation of cells in terms of tumorigenicity,           immunogenicity and the previously reported cell dedifferentiation phenomenon would be           mitigated by the exclusion of the cell element of this process, as they are considered           by some reports to present unpredictable mitotic behavior once artificially cultured.           The present study aims to further extend this translational investigation following           preclinical studies by the principal investigator, proposing a prospective randomized           controlled clinical trial on the possible benefits associated with the application of a           tissue-engineered bone graft compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-cultured           medium (CM) and an hydroxylapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate-based synthetic bone           substitute (HP/β-TCP ceramic). Specific aims include analyses on the density of the           newly formed calcified tissue by computed tomography (CBCTs), expression of specific           immunohistochemical bone formation markers (RT-PCR) and histomorphometric bone quantity           evaluation. In a split-mouth study model, the resultant bone formation after HP/β-TCP           grafting with and without CM will be analyzed, compared and quantified at different time           points.        2. Materials and Methods      2.1- Study design      A prospective split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was chosen as study design for      the present investigation. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics Committee and      registration at the clinical trials.gov platform, following CONSORT guidelines, 20      consecutive patients who seek maxillary oral rehabilitation at the Department of Prosthetic      Dentistry of the School of Health and Life Sciences - PUCRS, Brazil, will be invited to      participate in the present investigation.      2.2 - Lipoplasty and human adipose stem cells (hASCs) harvesting/culture.      For hASCs harvesting, an abdominal lipoplasty procedure will be proposed and performed      following a signed informed consent. Under intravenous sedation and supplementary oxygen      release with an oral catheter, along with local anesthesia, a standard surgical lipoplasty      technique will be performed. As previously described, from this liposuction material, 25 to      30 ml of fat will be transferred into a 50 ml Falcon tube. The fat will be then washed by      centrifugation (430Å~g 10 min), being the upper fat layer transferred into a new Falcon tube,      where an equal volume of collagenase solution will be added to the mixture and incubated at      37°C in a water bath. After centrifugation, the upper fat layer will be discarded and the      supernatant removed. The remaining cell pellet containing the hASCs will be resuspended with      15 ml of culture medium. After adding 15 ml of warm culture medium, the cell suspension will      be transferred into a T175 culture flask. The hASCs will be incubated in a humidified      environment at 37°C and 5% CO2. Then, the cell pellet will be resuspended in warm culture      medium and seeded into new cell culture flasks.      2.3 - Concentrated culture medium (CM) preparation and analysis      Stem cell culture and CM preparation will be performed at a GMP certified facility for      regenerative medicine products. At first, the surface antigen profiles of isolated hASCs at      third passage will be characterized by flow cytometry. The presence of CD73, CD90, CD105 and      CD44 markers and the absence of CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19 and HLA-DR will be assessed to      confirm the desired cell phenotype as recommended by protocols of the International Society      of Cellular Therapy.[ Then, a sample of these cells will be also characterized by staining      (Alizarin Red S) in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell expansion and CM will      be generated following standard stem cell culture protocols. Before clinical use, CM will be      examined not only for contamination with bacteria, fungi, or mycoplasmas but also for      infection with viruses including hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency and human T-cell      leukemia viruses. Then, CM will be properly cool-stored and sent to clinical application (up      to 6 hours), to avoid long-term denaturation/inactivation of present signalling molecules, as      previously suggested.      2.4 - Maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure      Under IV sedation and supplementary oxygen release with an oral catheter, along with local      anesthesia, the maxillary bone will be grafted internally by drilling an access in the      lateral maxillary sinus wall. Sinus membrane dissection with careful release and elevation      will be also performed. Preoperative randomizing by computer-generated random numbers will be      used to determine test and control sinuses for each patient. The bony floor of the maxillary      sinus on the test site will be augmented with 4 to 5g of a synthetic bone substitute      (BoneCeramic™ 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM. The control site will receive similar      amount of bone substitute embedded in 10 to 15 ml of saline solution. Patients will be      released from hospital facility 2h after surgery. They will be instructed in postoperative      hygiene and eating behavior. All patients will receive postoperative antibiotic and      anti-inflammatory therapies.      2.5 - Implant placement and bone biopsies harvesting      After 6 months of healing, implant placement will follow routine surgical protocols as      recommended by the implant manufacturer. Under local anesthesia, a mid-crestal linear      incision and full-thickness flap will be performed with releasing incisions whenever      necessary. Then, with a 16:1 contra-angle attached to a surgical unit and a trephine bur (Ø      3mm), the grafted area correspondent to the 2nd premolar, 1st and 2nd molar regions will be      biopsied at both right and left sides of the maxilla (n=06 sites per patient), guided by a      previously made acrylic resin surgical stent. Bone biopsies will be then divided in two      segments, where one will be stored in 4% formaldehyde solution for histologic analysis and      the other in Eppendorf vials with RNALater for RT-PCR analysis. Then, the sequence of implant      surgical burs as recommended by the manufacturer will be followed for the placement of 6 to 8      implants per patient. Registration of primary stability at insertion will be done by both      manual torque wrench and classified into three groups. A healing abutment will be then      placed, and wound closure will be conducted with non-resorbable suture material A 6-month      one-stage healing protocol will be adopted for all implants.      2.6 - CBCT image analysis      High-resolution CBCT images will be obtained at three different time-points as part of the      treatment protocol, meaning at pre-operative bone graft [baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2] days      (implant placement pre-operative), aiming both pre-op surgical planning and post-op      evaluation of the bone formation. The morphometric bone parameters will be calculated in 3D      analysis according to the recommendations of the American Society for Bone and Mineral      Research (ASBMR) as previously proposed, and statistical analysis will be used to identify      the best parameter combinations aiming to differentiate trabecular bone into three bone      categories: (i) sparse-related to a loose bone structure, (ii) intermediate-related to a      well-structured trabecular bone, and (iii) dense bone types-related to a massive bone area      with little space between the trabeculae.      2.7 - Histologic and histomorphometric analyses      Following removal of graft biopsies at implant placement, bone blocks containing the control      and test bone sites will be shaped and decalcified with 5% HNO3. The blocks will dehydrate in      a graded alcohol series, clarify with xylene and be embedded in resin. Then, the resin will      be polymerised in a UV light chamber for 10h. Using a diamond micro saw, a total of three      3-μm-thick slices from each block will be ground transversely to each specimen long axis at      50, 100, and 150μm from their external portion. After this, routine staining with      hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Azur II and Pararosaniline will be done aiming to differentiate      between HP/β-TCP particles and newly formed bone. Microscopic analysis will be performed at      24X magnification using an optical stereo microscope connected to a digital camera. Image      analysis will be performed using the ImageJ® software.      2.8 - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)      Following the preparation of the collected graft biopsies for RNA extraction, real-time      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis will be applied to quantify      alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth factor, Osteonectin, Osteopontin and type 1      collagen.
