",      RATIONALE: Placing a gene that has been created in the laboratory into white blood cells may      make the body build an immune response to kill cancer cells.      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is resistant or refractory to      chemotherapy.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced      with the anti-CD20 vector (referred to as CART-20 cells).      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-20 cells. RT-PCR analysis of whole blood      will be used to detect and quantify survival of CART-20 TCR zeta:4-1BB over time.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-20 cell      infusions.      II. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-20 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph nodes.      III. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active CLL,      ALL, etc) determine tumor cell killing by CART-20 cells in vitro.      IV. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD20, and      assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-20 (loss of engraftment).      V. Determine the relative subsets of CART-20 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned groups according to order of enrollment.      Patients receive anti-CD20-CAR lentivirus vector-transduced autologous T cells with      41BB-gamma vector for 3-5 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable      toxicity.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.    ",,"

",      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory      into patient autologous or donor-derived T cells may make the body build immune response to      kill cancer cells.      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in      treating patients with B-cell leukemia or lymphoma that is relapsed (after stem cell      transplantation or intensive chemotherapy) or refractory to chemotherapy.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced      with the anti-CD19/CD22 vector (referred to as tanCART-19/22 cells).      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of tanCART-19/22 cells. RT-PCR (reverse      transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and      quantify survival of tanCART-19/22TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta:CD137 and TCR zeta cells over      time.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to tanCART-19/22      cell infusions.      II. CD137 transgene is measured by the relative engraftment levels of tanCART-19/22 CD137 and      TCR zeta cells over time.      III. Estimate relative trafficking of tanCART-19/22 cells to tumor in bone marrow and lymph      nodes.      IV. For patients with stored or accessible tumor cells (such as patients with active chronic      lymphocytic leukemia(CLL), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), etc) determine tumor cell      killing by tanCART-19/22 cells in vitro.      V. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-CD19/22,      and assess correlation with loss of detectable tanCART-19/20 (loss of engraftment).      VI. Determine the relative subsets of tanCART-19/22 T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment. Patients receive      anti-CD19/22-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling domains)vector-transduced      autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable      toxicity.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.    ",,"

",      To determine the safety and tolerability of the maximum dose for laboratory engineered Herpes      Simplex Virus-1 in patients who would not be eligible for surgical resection of recurrent      glioma To determine the safety and tolerability of the maximum dose for laboratory engineered      Herpes Simples Virus-1 in patients who would benefit from surgical resection of recurrent      glioma    ,"      M032 is a second-generation oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that is conditionally      replication competent; that is, similar to G207, a first generation oHSV, it can replicate in      tumor cells, but not in normal cells, thus killing the tumor cells directly through this      process. Replication of M032 in the tumor itself not only kills the infected tumor cells, but      causes the tumor cell to act as a factory to produce new virus. These virus particles are      released as the tumor cell dies, and can then proceed to infect other tumor cells in the      vicinity, and continue the process of tumor kill. In addition to this direct oncolytic      activity, the virus carries a therapeutic payload--acting as a gene therapy vector, too--and      causes the tumor cell to synthesize and secrete an immunity-stimulating protein called      Interleukin-12 (IL-12) before it is killed. This IL-12 is released and promotes an immune      response against surviving tumor cells, which increases the antitumor effect of the therapy.      The IL-12 that is expressed can also produce an anti-angiogenic effect, by interfering with      the production of new tumor blood vessels necessary to allow tumor growth. Anti-angiogenic      therapies potentially starve the tumor of necessary oxygen and nutrients. Thus, the M032 oHSV      produces three different potential mechanisms for antitumor effects. The virus has also been      genetically-engineered to minimize the production of any toxic effects for the patient      receiving the therapy.    ",,"

All radiation and additional chemotherapies must have been completed at             least 4 weeks prior to enrollment. Prior therapy with nitrosoureas must have been             completed at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment.          -  Age ≥18 years (age of majority for clinical trials in Alabama). Because no dosing or             adverse event data are currently available on the use of M032 in patients <18 years of             age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric             phase 1 single-agent trials.          -  Karnofsky Performance Status ≥70%          -  Life expectancy of greater than 4 weeks.          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:               -  Leukocytes: >3,000/μl               -  absolute neutrophil count: >1,500/μl               -  platelets: >100,000/μl               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits               -  AST(SGOT)(aspartate aminotransferase)/ALT(SGPT)(alanine aminotransferase): <2.5 X                  institutional upper limit of normal               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR               -  creatinine clearance: >60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels                  above institutional normal.          -  Residual lesion must be ≥1.0 cm and < 5.5 cm in diameter without bilateral extension             through the corpus callosum as determined by MRI as this is a locally delivered             treatment. These parameters will be re-evaluated on imaging done on the day of             catheter implantation and if the lesion no longer meets.          -  The effects of M032 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to             study entry and for the first six months after receiving M032. Because it is currently             unknown if M032 can be transmitted by sexual contact, a barrier method of birth             control must be employed and for six (6) months following the administration of the             study drug. Should a woman become pregnant while participating in this study, she             should inform her treating physician immediately. For two weeks after receiving M032,             subjects should avoid intimate contact with pregnant women, infants and young children             and individuals with decreased immunity (ability to fight infection). Subjects should             also refrain from donating blood during the trial          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.          -  Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant; this will be confirmed by a             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to starting study treatment.          -  Steroid use is allowed as long as dose has not increased within 2 weeks of scheduled             M032 administration. Whenever possible, the patient should be on a steroid dose that             is equivalent to a dexamethasone dose of ≤ 2mg daily at the time of treatment.        Exclusion Criteria          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, cytotoxic therapy, immunotherapy within 4 weeks             prior to entering the study (6 weeks for nitrosoureas), surgical resection within 4             weeks prior to entering the study, or have received experimental viral therapy or gene             therapy at any time (e.g., adenovirus, retrovirus or herpes virus protocol). However,             this does not preclude re-treatment with M032 at a later date.          -  Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to therapeutic interventions             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar biologic composition             to M032 or to IL-12.          -  Tumor involvement which would require ventricular, brainstem, basal ganglia, or             posterior fossa inoculation or would require access through a ventricle in order to             deliver treatment. Also, since M032 is a local treatment, patients whose tumors have             bilateral extension through the corpus callosum, those with actively growing             multifocal disease by MRI, and/or CSF dissemination/ leptomeningeal disease, are             ineligible.          -  Prior history of encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or other CNS infection.          -  Required steroid increase within 2 weeks of scheduled M032 administration. When             possible, the patient should be on a dexamethasone equivalent dose of ≤ 2mg daily at             the time of treatment.          -  Active oral herpes lesion.          -  Concurrent therapy with any drug active against HSV (acyclovir, valacyclovir,             penciclovir, famciclovir, gancyclovir, foscarnet, cidofovir).          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac             arrhythmia, or any other medical condition that precludes surgery. Also, psychiatric             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.          -  Excluded patient groups               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M032 is a viral oncolytic                  therapy with unknown potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because                  there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants                  secondary to treatment of the mother with M032, breastfeeding women will not be                  included in the study.               -  Because patients with immune deficiency will be unable to mount the anticipated                  immune response underlying this therapeutic rationale, HIV-seropositive patients                  are excluded from this study. Other treatment studies for this disease that are                  less dependent on the patients' immune response are more appropriate for                  HIV-seropositive patients.          -  Patients with known history of allergic reaction to IV contrast material that is not             amenable to pre-treatment by University of Alabama at Birmingham protocol.          -  Patients with pacemakers, ferro-magnetic aneurysm clips, metal infusion pumps, metal             or shrapnel fragments or certain types of stents.          -  Receipt of Gliadel Therapy.          -  (Receipt of Bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy within 4 weeks of scheduled M032             administration. (Receipt of Bevacizumab (Avastin) greater than 4 weeks of scheduled             M032 administration does not exclude patient.)          -  Any other reason the investigator deems subject is unfit for participation in the             study.

","      This phase I trial tests the feasibility and safety of genetically modified cytotoxic      T-lymphocytes in controlling infections caused by adenovirus (ADV), BK virus (BKV),      cytomegalovirus (CMV), JC virus (JCV), or COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients with cancer.      Viral infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell      transplantation, and therapeutic options for these infections are often complicated by      associated toxicities. Genetically modified cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are designed to      kill a specific virus that can cause infections. Depending on which virus a patient is      infected with (ADV, BKV, CMV, JCV, or COVID-19), the CTLs will be designed to specifically      attack that virus. Giving genetically modified CTLs may help to control the infection.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of administering genetically engineered      glucocorticoid receptor knock out virus specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines in      immunosuppressed cancer patients with viral infections (BKV, JCV, CMV, adenovirus, COVID19).      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To obtain preliminary data about the efficacy of administering genetically engineered      glucocorticoid receptor knock out virus specific CTL lines in immunosuppressed cancer      patients with viral infections (BKV, JCV, CMV, adenovirus, COVID19).      II. To assess the persistence of the administered cells in the patients. III. To obtain data      about relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).      OUTLINE:      Patients receive virus-specific CTLs intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients with      partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease may receive up to 8 additional      infusions of virus-specific CTL at least 2 weeks between each infusion.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up yearly for 15 years.    ",,"

","      Background:      A person s tumor is studied for mutations. When cells are found that can attack the mutation      in a person s tumor, the genes from those cells are studied to find the parts that make the      attack possible. White blood cells are then taken from the person s body, and the gene      transfer occurs in a laboratory. A type of virus is used to transfer the genes that make      those white blood cells able to attack the mutation in the tumor. The gene transfer therapy      is the return of those white blood cells back to the person.      Objective:      To see if gene transfer therapy of white blood cells can shrink tumors.      Eligibility:      People with certain metastatic cancer for which standard treatments have not worked.      Design:      Participants may complete screening under another protocol. Screening includes:        -  Getting tumor cells from a previous procedure        -  Medical history        -  Physical exam        -  Scans        -  Blood, urine, heart, and lung tests      The study has 8 stages:        1. Screening tests repeated over 1-2 weeks. Participants will have leukapheresis: Blood is           removed by a needle in one arm. A machine removes white blood cells. The rest of the           blood is returned by a needle in the other arm.        2. Care at home over approximately 12 weeks.        3. Stopping therapy for 4-6 weeks while their cells are changed in a lab.        4. Hospital stay approximately 3-4 weeks for treatment. An IV catheter will be placed in           the chest to administer drugs.        5. Patients on Arm 2 of the study will receive the first dose of pembrolizumab while in the           hospital. Three additional doses will be given after the cell infusion 3 weeks apart.        6. Receiving changed cells by catheter. Then getting a drug over 1-5 days to help the cells           live longer.        7. Recover in the hospital for 1-2 weeks. Participants will get drugs and have blood and           urine tests.        8. Participants will take an antibiotic and maybe an antiviral for at least 6 months after           treatment. They will have repeat screening tests at visits every few months for the           first year, every 6 months for the second year, then as determined.           ...    ","      Background:        -  The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate           complete, durable regressions in 20-25% of participants with metastatic melanoma. Recent           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated neoantigens           expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to participants with a variety of other solid           cancers, including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have           little if any therapeutic impact.        -  Recent studies in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch, (NCI-SB), have shown           that TIL from non-melanoma solid cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against           non-shared unique mutated or oncoviral neoantigens expressed in the cancer. The           frequency of these T-cells is very low (often < 0.1%) and it is thus difficult to           isolate and grow mutation reactive T-cells to levels required for effective therapy.        -  In a single patient with chemo-refractory metastatic cholangiocarcinoma we were able to           grow a relatively pure population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these           cells mediated a near-complete regression of all metastatic disease now lasting 2.5           years.        -  We have developed approaches to identify these rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from           common non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express these TCRs with high           efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene-modified cells can recognize and destroy the           autologous cancer in vitro.        -  In addition to reactivity to neoantigens derived from nonsynonymous mutations, T-cells           can recognize human papilloma virus (HPV) epitopes in participants with HPV- induced           cancers. The TCR from these reactive cells can be isolated and retrovirally-transduced           into autologous PBL with high efficiency.        -  With these techniques, we have isolated a number of TCRs selectively recognizing shared           mutated oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, TP53) or shared oncoviral proteins (e.g. HPV) in the           context of several major histocompatibility complexes (MHC-I and MHC-II).        -  This clinical protocol will treat participants with refractory solid cancers using the           adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transduced with genes encoding TCRs that recognize           unique mutated or oncoviral neoantigens expressed by the cancer.      Objectives:      -Primary objective:      --Determine the rate of objective response (using RECIST v1.1 criteria) of participants with      solid cancers who receive pembrolizumab plus autologous PBL (Arm 2) that have been transduced      with genes encoding T-cell receptors that recognize mutated or oncoviral neoantigens in the      autologous cancer      Eligibility:      -Participants must be/have:        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years        -  Metastatic solid cancer with at least one lesion that can be measured, that falls into           one of four cohorts: (1) gastrointestinal and genitourinary cancers; (2) breast,           ovarian, and other solid cancers; (3) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and, (4)           endocrine tumors including neuroendocrine tumors.        -  Evaluable solid cancer that has recurred following standard chemotherapy or standard           systemic therapy        -  Normal basic laboratory values.        -  No allergies or hypersensitivity to high-dose aldesleukin administration        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency.      Design:        -  Participants will have already undergone resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for           generation of autologous TIL cultures. This will have been conducted under the NCI-SB           cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch           Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).        -  Exomic sequencing, and often RNA-Seq will be performed to identify the mutations           expressed in the patient s cancer. Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and           tested for reactivity against mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have           developed that involve the exposure of autologous antigen-presenting cells to long           peptides containing the mutation or tandem mini-genes encoding the mutation.        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutations will be identified and the individual           T- cell receptors that recognize the mutation will be synthesized and used to create a           retrovirus for transduction of the TCR into the patient s autologous PBL.        -  Participants that present with tumors expressing oncoviral neoantigens will be treated           with autologous PBLs retrovirally transduced with TCR(s) targeting the oncoviral           neoantigen.        -  Participants that present with tumors expressing mutated shared oncogenes (e.g., KRAS,           TP53) or oncoviral proteins (e.g., HPV) that also express the appropriate restriction           element may be treated with autologous PBLs retrovirally transduced with TCR(s)           previously isolated in the Surgery Branch targeting the shared mutated antigen. These           participants will be administered a cell infusion product of TCRs targeting mutated           shared oncogenes (e.g., KRAS, TP53) or oncoviral proteins (e.g., HPV). Their cell           infusion product will not include PBL transduced with unique (i.e., non-shared) TCR(s).        -  Participants will be enrolled into one of four cohorts: (1) metastatic gastrointestinal           and genitourinary cancers; (2) metastatic breast, ovarian, and other solid cancers; (3)           metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and, (4) metastatic endocrine tumors           including neuroendocrine tumors. Autologous PBL transduced with TCR(s) targeting           neoantigens (mutated shared oncogenes e.g., TP53, KRAS, individual non-synonymous           mutations , or oncoviral proteins) will then be expanded to large numbers using our           standard rapid expansion protocol.        -  Participants enrolled on Arm 1 and Arm 2 will receive a non-myeloablative,           lymphodepleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine           followed by the infusion of autologous transduced PBL and high-dose aldesleukin. At the           discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI), participants enrolled in Cohort 3 (NSCLC)           may receive low-dose aldesleukin.        -  Participants enrolled on Arm 2 will receive pembrolizumab prior to cell administration           and three additional doses every three weeks following the cell infusion. Participants           who have experienced major organ toxicity due to previous treatment with pembrolizumab           (or equivalent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade) will be enrolled on Arm 1.        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after cell infusion           and periodically thereafter.        -  It is anticipated that approximately one participant per month may enroll on the trial           for each of the four histologic cohorts for Arm 2. There will be a limit of 15           participants per cohort enrolled on Arm 1 (60 participants for Arm 1), and accrual of up           to 4 x 50 = 200 total evaluable participants on Arm 2. It is expected that once full           manufacturing capability is reached, the accrual may be completed in approximately 4-5           years. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable participants, the accrual           ceiling will be set to 270.    ","

",,"      The purpose of this Phase I study is to test the safety of different doses of specially      prepared immune cells (called ""T cells"") collected from blood. The Investigators want to find      a safe dose of these modified T cells for patients who have malignant pleural disease. They      want to find out what effects these T cells have on the patient and the cancer (MPD).      Phase 2 part of the study, the investigators will test the dose in combination with another      drug, pembrolizumab, to see what effects the study treatment has on malignant pleural      mesothelioma.    ","      This is an open-label, dose-escalating, non randomized, single-center, phase I/II study of      mesothelin-targeted T cells administered intrapleurally as an infusion in patients with a      diagnosis (histologically or cytologically documented) of MPD from mesothelioma, lung cancer,      or breast cancer. Patients receiving pembrolizumab in cohort 9 only includes patients with a      diagnosis of mesothelioma. The total number of patients studied will depend on the number of      dose levels tested, up to a maximum dose of 6×10^7 mesothelin-targeted T cells/kg or until      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. In Phase I of this study, we anticipate infusing      a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 54 evaluable patients. The total number of enrolled patients      in Phase II of this study depends on the number of observed responses and ranges from 13-21      evaluable patients, including 6 patients treated at the final dose in Phase I.      For patients who were treated and were removed from study, duplicate enrollment is permitted      if it is determined the patients could receive benefit. If the patients meet all eligibility      criteria, they may receive treatment in a higher dose level cohort. Patients who are      re-treated with CAR T cell therapy will not be considered new accruals. Outcomes of      re-treated patients will be analyzed separately.      Patients may receive palliative radiotherapy for symptom management prior to or following the      CAR T cell infusion. If a patient receives palliative radiotherapy, the study PI, treating      Radiation Oncologist, and treating Medical Oncologist will decide whether to proceed with the      infusion. Palliative radiotherapy must be completed at least 2 days prior to the      administration of cyclophosphamide.      Patients in cohort 9 and in the Phase II portion of the study will begin treatment with      pembrolizumab 4 weeks (+3/-1 week window) after completing CAR T cell administration.      Patients will receive 3 doses of pembrolizumab given on a recurring schedule followed by      reassessment. Patients responding or deriving clinical benefit, without unacceptable      toxicity, will be followed for up to 6 months after the first dose of pembrolizumab and may      continue pembrolizumab. Patients who cannot receive all 6 doses of pembrolizumab at MSK will      be followed and medical records including images will be obtained from the treating      physician.    ",,"

","      This trial will evaluate safety and efficacy of human engineered T-cell therapies, in      participants with advanced tumors.    ","      New York esophageal antigen-1 (NY-ESO-1) and LAGE-1a antigens are tumor-associated proteins      that have been found in several tumor types. Clinical trials using adoptively transferred T      cells directed against NY-ESO-1/LAGE-1a have shown objective responses. Letetresgene      autoleucel (lete-cel, GSK3377794) is the first generation of NY-ESO-1 specific T-cell      receptor engineered T cells. This is a master protocol investigating T-cell therapies. It      will initially consist of a core protocol with two independent substudies investigating      Letetresgene autoleucel (lete-cel) in previously untreated (1L) Human Leukocyte Antigen      (HLA)-A*02+ participants with NY-ESO-1+ advanced (metastatic or unresectable) synovial      sarcoma (SS) or myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) (Substudy 1) and Letetresgene      autoleucel as second line or higher (2L+) treatment in HLA-A*02+ participants with NY-ESO-1+      advanced (metastatic or unresectable) SS or MRCLS who have progressed following treatment      with anthracycline based chemotherapy (Substudy 2).

","      Background:      A cancer treatment has been developed called ""gene transfer"" or ""gene therapy."" It involves      taking white blood cells from a person (called apheresis), genetically modifying the cells in      a lab to recognize cancer, and then giving the cells back to the person. Researchers want to      see if this treatment can help people with metastatic squamous cell anal cancer.      Objective:      To see if treating cancer with a person s own white blood cells that have been genetically      modified can cause tumors to shrink.      Eligibility:      People who have metastatic squamous cell anal cancer for which standard treatments have not      worked.      Design:      Participants will have had a tumor biopsy and apheresis to collect white blood cells under a      separate protocol.      Participants will stay at the hospital for 3 to 4 weeks. They will have an intravenous (IV)      catheter placed in a large vein in the upper chest.      Participants will get chemotherapy drugs (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide), the cell      infusion, and aldesleukin through the IV. Pembrolizumab is given before and for three doses      given every three weeks after the cell infusion. Aldesleukin will help the cells grow.      Participants will take an antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal by mouth. They will get an      injection of filgrastim. It will stimulate the formation of white blood cells.      Participants will have blood and urine tests. They will have physical exams. Their symptoms      will be reviewed. They will have imaging scans.      About 6 and 12 weeks after they finish treatment, participants will have safety follow-up      visits. These visits will take 1 to 2 days.      Participants will return to the Clinical Center every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, and then as      determined by their doctor. They will be followed long term for up to 15 years on a separate      study.    ","      Background:        -  The administration of autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate           complete, durable regressions in 20-25% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Recent           studies have shown that these TIL predominantly recognize unique mutated or viral           neoantigens expressed by the cancer not shared by other melanomas.        -  Administration of bulk autologous TIL to patients with a variety of other solid cancers,           including cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary tract, have little if           any therapeutic impact.        -  Recent studies in the National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) have shown that           TIL from non-melanoma solid cancers can also contain T-cells reactive against nonshared           unique mutated neoantigens expressed in the cancer. The frequency of these Tcells is           very low (often < 0.1%) and it is thus difficult to isolate and grow mutation reactive           T-cells to levels required for effective therapy.        -  In a single patient with chemo-refractory metastatic cholangiocarcinoma, we were able to           grow a relatively pure population of neoantigen reactive TIL and administration of these           cells mediated a near-complete regression of all metastatic disease now lasting 2.5           years.        -  We have developed approaches to identify rare neoantigen reactive T-cells from common           non-melanoma cancers, to isolate their T-cell receptors (TCR), and to genetically           engineer autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) to express these TCRs with high           efficiency. The neoantigen TCR gene-modified cells can recognize and destroy the           autologous cancer in vitro.        -  In addition to reactivity to neoantigens derived from nonsynonymous mutations, T-cells           can recognize human papilloma virus (HPV) epitopes in patients with HPV-induced cancers.           The TCR from these reactive cells can be isolated and retrovirally-transduced into           autologous PBL with high efficiency. This clinical protocol will treat a single patient           with refractory anal cancer using the adoptive transfer of autologous PBL transduced           with genes encoding TCRs that recognize unique mutated or viral neoantigens expressed by           the cancer.      Objective:      -Under a single-patient IND, to treat a patient with metastatic HPV-16 positive squamous cell      anal cancer with autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) that have been transduced with      genes encoding T-cell receptors that recognize mutated or viral neoantigens in the autologous      cancer.      Eligibility:        -  Must have measurable, metastatic disease as assessed per RECIST v1.1 criteria.        -  Must sign the informed consent document.        -  Willing to sign Durable Power of Attorney Form.        -  Must have all regulatory approvals prior to start of treatment.      Design:        -  This patient will have already undergone resection or biopsy to obtain tumor for           generation of autologous TIL cultures. This will have been conducted under the NCI-SB           cell harvest protocol 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch           Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols).        -  Exomic sequencing and RNA-Seq will be performed to identify the mutations expressed in           the patient s cancer. Multiple autologous TIL cultures will be grown and tested for           reactivity against mutations from the autologous tumor using assays we have developed           that involve the exposure of autologous antigen-presenting cells to long peptides           containing the mutation or tandem mini-genes encoding the mutation.        -  T-cell cultures with reactivity against mutated and viral neoantigens will be identified           and the individual T-cell receptors that recognize the neoantigens will be synthesized           and used to create retroviral supernatants for transduction of the TCR into the patient           s autologous PBL.        -  The patient will be treated with a non-myeloablative, lymphodepleting preparative           regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by the infusion of autologous           transduced PBL and then high-dose aldesleukin. The patient will also receive           pembrolizumab on Day -2 prior to cell administration and three additional doses every           three weeks following the cell infusion.        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after cell infusion           and periodically thereafter.

",,"      The purpose of this phase I study is to test the safety of different dose levels of specially      prepared cells collected called ""modified T cells"". In the screening part of this study the      tumor was found to have a protein called MUC16. This protein is present on about 70% of      ovarian cancers. The investigators want to find a safe dose of modified T cells for patients      with this type of cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. We also want to      find out what effects these modified T cells have on the patient and their cancer.    ","      There are 2 phases to the study: the Screening Phase and the Intervention Phase. Only      patients identified as eligible from the Screening Phase may enroll in the Intervention      Phase.      Screening Phase: After signing Informed Consent 1 (Screening Informed Consent), the patient's      MUC16ecto tumor expression will be determined as previously described. In order to be      eligible for this protocol, the patient's ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian tube      carcinoma must express the MUC16ecto protein detectable by IHC analysis of banked (paraffin      embedded) or fresh biopsied tumor. After signing Informed Consent 1, approximately 2 weeks      will elapse while the patient's banked tumor is tested for MUC16ecto expression. If a      patient's tumor is found to express MUC16ecto, she will undergo leukapheresis for the      collection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which will be frozen for future use.      The leukapheresis product will be stored until the end of the study in case future research      tests related to this study are developed.      Intervention Phase: Patients must sign Informed Consent 2 (Intervention Informed Consent)      before receiving treatment on the study before receiving treatment on the study.      Once the patient is eligible to receive the CAR+ T cells, the frozen leukapheresis product      will be thawed and used to generate the 4H11-28z/fIL-12/EGFRt+ genetically-modified T cells.      It is expected to take approximately 4-6 weeks to prepare the autologous CAR+ T cells.      On day 1-3 patients in cohorts V will receive conditioning chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide      750 mg/m^2 or 300 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide concurrent with 25-30 mg/m2 fludarabine 2-7 days      prior to the initial infusion of autologous CAR+T cells. Patients will receive autologous      CAR+T cells in 2 infusions, the first IV and the second IP, each comprising about half the      total dose. The IV infusion will be given first. The patient will then be closely monitored.      One to 3 days later if clinically stable, the patient will receive the remaining dose of      CAR+T cells IP. Patients in cohort I or -I will not receive cyclophosphamide, but will      receive the T cells in the same manner (approximately half IV, followed by close monitoring      and then 1-3 days later, if the patient is clinically stable, the remaining cells will be      administered IP).

",      This phase I clinical trial evaluates the safety and feasibility of administering NY-ESO-1      TCR (T cell receptor)engineered peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and peripheral      blood stem cells (PBSC) after a myeloablative conditioning regimen to treat patients with      cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. The conditioning chemotherapy makes room      in the patient?s bone marrow for new blood cells (PBMC) and blood-forming cells (stem cells)      to grow. Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC and stem cells after the conditioning chemotherapy is      intended to replace the immune system with new immune cells that have been redirected to      attack and kill the cancer cells and thereby improve immune system function against cancer.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To determine the safety of administering the combination of autologous peripheral blood      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) following a reduced      intensity conditioning regimen, both of which have been genetically modified to express      NY-ESO-1 TCR.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the combination of TCR transduced autologous      PBMC and CD34+ PBSC to patients.      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBMC and the progeny of TCR      transduced PBSC in serial peripheral blood samples.      III. Objective response rate (ORR).      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:      I. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET      tracer 9-4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butylguanine ([18F]FHBG) with the goal of determining      whether the adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBSC home to bone marrow,      differentiate into T cells and expand in secondary lymphoid organs and tumor deposits.      OUTLINE:      G-CSF AND PLERIXAFOR MOBILIZED LEUKAPHERESIS: Between 6 months and 3 weeks before infusion of      cells, patients undergo G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization of CD34+ peripheral blood stem      cells. Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously (SC) on mobilization days 1-8 and plerixafor SC      on mobilization days 4-7, during mobilization, patients will undergo mobilized leukapheresis      to obtain PBSC. Patients also undergo an unmobilized leukapheresis on day -5 before infusion      of cells in order to obtain PBMC.      CHEMOTHERAPY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) on days -4 to      -2 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -3 to -2.      Patients receive LV-NYESO TCR/sr39TK PBSC IV on day 0, and after approximately 24 hours,      patients receive RV-NYESO TCR PBMC IV on day 1. Beginning on day 2, patients receive      aldesleukin (interleukin-2 (IL) or IL-2) SC twice daily (BID) for up to 7 days. Patients      undergo blood collection for safety and immune monitoring on days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 30, 60,      90, and 120. Patients receive the PET tracer 18F-FHBG IV, and after 1 hour, undergo      PET/computed tomography (CT) on days 25 and 120.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for 2 years,      every 6 months for 5 years, and annually for 15 years.    ",,"

",      This phase I trial studies the side effects of NY-ESO-1 TCR engineered peripheral blood      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) after melphalan conditioning      regimen in treating participants with multiple myeloma that has come back or does not respond      to treatment. The melphalan conditioning chemotherapy makes room in the patient?s bone marrow      for new blood cells (PBMC) and blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow. Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR      PBMC and stem cells after the conditioning chemotherapy is intended to replace the immune      system with new immune cells that have been redirected to attack and kill the cancer cells      and thereby improve immune system function against cancer. Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR PBMC and PBSC      after melphalan may work better at treating multiple myeloma.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the safety of administering the combination of autologous peripheral blood      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) following a melphalan      conditioning regimen, both of which have been genetically modified to express NY-ESO-1 TCR.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the combination of T-cell receptor (TCR)      transduced autologous PBMC and CD34+ PBSC to patients.      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBMC and the progeny of TCR      transduced PBSC in serial peripheral blood samples.      III. Objective response rate (ORR).      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET      tracer 9-4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butylguanine ([18F]FHBG) with the goal of determining      whether the adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBSC home to bone marrow,      differentiate into T cells and expand in secondary lymphoid organs and extramedullary disease      sites.      OUTLINE:      G-CSF AND PLERIXAFOR MOBILIZED LEUKAPHERESIS: Between 6 months and 3 weeks before infusion of      cells, participants undergo G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization of CD34+ peripheral blood stem      cells. Participants receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on mobilization days 1-4 and up to      mobilization day 8 and plerixafor SC starting on mobilization day 4 up to day 8. During      mobilization, participants will undergo mobilized leukapheresis to obtain PBSC. Participants      also undergo an unmobilized leukapheresis on day -5 before infusion of cells in order to      obtain PBMC.      CHEMOTHERAPY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Participants receive melphalan intravenously (IV) on days      -3 to -2.      Participants receive LV-NYESO TCR/sr39TK PBSC IV on day 0, and RV-NYESO TCR PBMC IV on day 1.      Beginning on day 2, participants receive aldesleukin (interleukin-2 or IL-2) SC twice daily      (BID) for up to 7 days. Participants receive the 18F-FHBG IV, and after 1 hour, undergo      PET/computed tomography (CT) on days 30 and 90. After day 100, participants receive      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 21 days. Courses of lenalidomide repeat every 28      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up monthly after day 90 until      disease progression and annually for up to 15 years.    ","

","Incidence of dose limiting toxicityUp to 90 daysSafety will be assessed by monitoring and recording potential adverse effects of the treatment using the Common Toxicity Criteria at each study visit. Subjects will be monitored by medical histories, physical examinations and blood studies to detect potential toxicities from the treatment. If there are no dose limiting toxicities observed, the cohort will be expanded to 12 subjects. If 1/3 are observed, up to 6 subjects will be recruited. If less than 2/6 are observed, the cohort will be expanded to a total of 12 subjects. If a dose limiting toxicity is observed in 2 or more of 6 subjects, then this dose level will have exceeded the 33% rate, and the study will be terminated.","

","      A clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of genetically-engineered,      neoantigen-specific Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) in which the intracellular immune      checkpoint CISH has been inhibited using CRISPR gene editing for the treatment of      Gastro-Intestinal (GI) Cancer.    ","      Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) have shown efficacy in certain cancers, principally in      melanoma. Efficacy in more common solid tumors has been demonstrated via the selection of      cancer neoantigen-specific TIL. Combination cell surface checkpoint inhibitor therapy has      also been employed in an attempt to enhance the efficacy of these cell therapies. Genetic      engineering of T cells to further increase anti-tumor activity is now possible.      CISH (Cytokine-induced SH2 protein) is a novel intra-cellular immune checkpoint and an      important negative regulator of T-cell signaling and function. The inhibition of CISH in      mouse anti-tumor lymphocytes results in a marked increase in the ability of these lymphocytes      to mediate tumor regression following administration to tumor bearing mice.      Additionally, data in genetically-engineered, neoantigen-specific human T cells in which CISH      was inhibited, showed enhanced TCR functional avidity and increased ability of these T cells      to detect cancer specific mutations and mount robust polyfunctional cytokine immune responses      against their cognate cancer antigens. Thus, these T cells appear to have a significant      advantage in inducing anti-tumor responses compared to wild-type anti-tumor lymphocytes.      The researchers have developed and optimized a CRISPR/Cas9 based strategy for precise and      efficient genetic engineering in primary human T-cells without sacrificing cell viability or      function, allowing for inhibition of a heretofore undruggable intracellular checkpoint.      Thus, in this protocol, the researchers propose to inhibit the gene encoding the      intracellular checkpoint target CISH in lymphocytes from patients with metastatic cancers      that are selected for anti-tumor activity in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of      genetically engineered T cell therapy for solid tumors in the setting of novel checkpoint      inhibition.

","      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of genetically engineered      lymphocyte therapy and to see how well it works after peripheral blood stem cell transplant      (PBSCT) in treating patients with high-risk, intermediate-grade, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma      (NHL). Genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy may stimulate the immune system in different      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving rituximab together with chemotherapy before a      PBSCT stops the growth of cancer cells by stopping them from dividing or killing them. Giving      colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF), or plerixafor helps stem cells move      from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. More chemotherapy or      radiation therapy is given to prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell transplant. The stem      cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming cells that were destroyed      by the chemotherapy. Giving genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy after PBSCT may be an      effective treatment for NHL    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the safety of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex vivo      expanded autologous central memory T cell (TCM)-enriched cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ T      cells genetically-modified to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) in      conjunction with a standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation      (aHSCT) for research participants with high-risk intermediate grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin      lymphomas who have relapsed after primary therapy, or who did not achieve complete remission      with primary therapy. (Phase I)      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and to      describe the full toxicity profile. (Phase I)      III. To determine the rate of research participants receiving TCM-enriched CD8+ T cells      genetically-modified to express a CD19-specific CAR for which the transferred cells are      detected in the circulation 28 days (+/- 3 days) by woodchuck hepatitis virus      post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) quantitative (Q)-polymerase chain reaction      (PCR). (Phase II)      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the tempo, magnitude, and duration of engraftment of      the transferred T cell product as it relates to the number of cells infused. (Phase II)      II. To study the impact of this therapeutic intervention on the development of CD19+ B-cell      precursors in the bone marrow as a surrogate for the in vivo effector function of transferred      CD19-specific T cells. (Phase II)      III. To describe the progression-free and overall survival of treated research participants      on this protocol. (Phase II)      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of genetically engineered lymphocyte      therapy followed by a phase II study. Patients receive standard salvage chemotherapy per      standard practice and undergo standard mobilization for stem cell collection with filgrastim      and/or plerixafor. Some patients may also receive rituximab intravenously (IV) within 4 weeks      of transplant. Patients receive standard myeloablative conditioning followed by autologous      PBSCT. Patients then undergo infusion of ex vivo expanded autologous TCM-enriched CD8+ T      cells expressing CD19-specific CAR on day 2 or 3 after transplant.

","      This phase I trial is studying the side effects of giving genetically engineered lymphocytes      together with cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin in treating patients with relapsed or      refractory mantle cell lymphoma or indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Placing a gene that      has been created in the laboratory into white blood cells may make the body build an immune      response to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping      them from dividing. Aldesleukin may stimulate the white blood cells to kill lymphoma cells.      Giving genetically engineered lymphocytes together with cyclophosphamide and aldesleukin may      be an effective treatment for mantle cell lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To assess the feasibility, safety and toxicity of cellular immunotherapy utilizing ex-vivo      expanded autologous T cells genetically modified to express a ""second generation' cluster of      differentiation (CD)20-specific scFvFc:CD28:CD137:zeda chimeric immunoreceptor in patients      with recurrent or refractory CD20+ mantle cell or indolent lymphoma.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CD20-specific T      cells transfected with a CD20-specific scFvFc:CD28:CD137:zeda chimeric immunoreceptor.      II. To assess the trafficking of CD20-specific T cells to lymphoma masses. III. To evaluate      the development of host anti-CD20 scFvFc:CD28:CD137:zeda chimeric immunoreceptor and      anti-neomycin-resistance gene (NeoR) immune responses in study subjects.      OUTLINE:      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes.      IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 2 days after completion of cyclophosphamide, patients receive      autologous CD20-specific T-cells IV over 30 minutes. Treatment repeats every 2-5 days for 3      courses.      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Beginning 2 hours after the last T-cell infusion, patients receive      low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously twice daily for 14 days.      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.      Subjects who have achieved at least a partial remission lasting a minimum of 6 months may, on      a case-by-case basis, receive additional stored T cells following relapse.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for one month, monthly      for 1 year, and then annually for up to 2 years.    ",,"

","      This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects of genetically engineered cells called      FH-MagIC TCR-T cells and how well they work with atezolizumab in treating patients with      triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that has      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). T cells are infection fighting blood cells      that can kill tumor cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and      will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize MAGE-A1, a protein on the      surface of tumor cells. These MAGE-A1-specific T cells may help the body's immune system      identify and kill MAGE-A1 tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving FH-MagIC TCR-T cells with atezolizumab may      help treat patients with triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell      lung cancer.    ","      OUTLINE:      This is a phase I, dose escalation study of FH-MagIC TCR-T cells followed by a phase II      study.      LYMPHODEPLETION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and fludarabine IV on      days -4, -3, and -2 before each T-cell infusion.      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive FH-MagIC TCR-T cells IV over 15-20 minutes. Six to twelve      weeks after first T-cell infusion, patients with progressive disease and non-persisting      transgenic TCR T cells may receive a second T-cell infusion.      In the Phase 2 portion of the study, atezolizumab will be administered as standard of care      beginning 24-72 hours after T-cell infusion. Atezolizumab will be given IV every 3 weeks for      at least 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If an      alternative PD1 inhibitor is instead available for a patient, it may be substituted instead.

","      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor (TCR)      engineered T cells and how well they work with NY-ESO-1 TCR engineered hematopoietic stem      cells (HSCs) after melphalan conditioning regimen in treating patients with ovarian,      fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent) or does not      respond to treatment (refractory). The melphalan conditioning chemotherapy makes room in the      patient's bone marrow for new blood cells and blood-forming cells (stem cells) to grow.      Giving NY-ESO-1 TCR T cells and stem cells after the conditioning chemotherapy is intended to      replace the immune system with new immune cells that have been redirected to attack and kill      the cancer cells and thereby improve immune system function against cancer. Giving NY-ESO-1      TCR engineered T cells and HSCs after melphalan may work better in treating patients with      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of autologous peripheral      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) that have been      genetically modified ex vivo to express NY-ESO-1 TCR, following a myeloablative conditioning      regimen.      Ia. Assessment of toxicities using Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and definition of a maximum      tolerated dose (MTD).      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. TCR engineered hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) engraftment. II. Functional assays for TCR      transgenic cells. III. Progression-free survival (PFS) (compare with the duration of the PFS      in the last treatment regimen).      IV. Durable tumor response in at least 30% of the patients defined as immune-related complete      response (irCR) or immune-related partial response (irPR) by immune-related Response      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria at 6 months.      V. Long-term persistence of TCR transgenic cells (regardless of cell origin) as evidenced by      > 5% of CD3 lymphocytes being NY-ESO-1 specific by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)      tetramer assay at 3 and 6 months.      VI. Discrimination of TCR transgenic cells resulting from retrovirally-transduced mature      lymphocytes and lentivirally-transduced HSCs and their phenotyping.      VII. Long term monitoring for replication competent retrovirus and lentivirus. VIII. Analysis      of viral insertion sites in long term persisting NY-ESO-1 TCR clones: absence of a clonal      expansion of TCR transgenic cells with a particular transgene insertion site (defined as a      clone comprising > 20% of all PBSC-derived gene-marked cells).      IX. Gut microbiota pre and post treatment to evaluate the role of microbiota on the      therapeutic efficacy of the proposed therapy.      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous NY-ESO-1-specific CD8-positive T      lymphocytes.      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -1. Patients then      receive autologous NY-ESO-1 CD4-TCR CD34+ HSC IV on day 0 and autologous NY-ESO-1-specific      CD8-positive T lymphocytes IV between days 7 and 21. Patients also receive aldesleukin      subcutaneously (SC) twice daily (BID) for 14 days on the following day after the T cell      infusion (between days 8 and 22).      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years,      then annually for up to 15 years.    ",,"

","      This phase I trial studies the side effects of genetically modified T cells and decitabine in      treating patients with recurrent or refractory epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that has come back or has not responded to previous      treatments. White blood cells called T cells are collected via a process called      leukapheresis, genetically modified to recognize and attack tumor cells, then given back to      the patient. Decitabine may induce and increase the amount of the target protein NY-ESO-1      available on the surface of tumor cells. Giving genetically modified T cells and decitabine      may kill more tumor cells.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the autologous NY-ESO-1 redirected T cell      therapy in combination with decitabine and low-dose IL-2 in patients with treatment      refractory or recurrent epithelial or non-epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal or fallopian      tube carcinoma.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To evaluate the persistence of genetically modified cells in the peripheral blood, and at      tumor sites.      II. To examine the effect of the treatment on tumor as measured by objective tumor response      and progression free survival, both assessed by immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria      in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).      III. To assess the occurrence of target antigen and/or major histocompatibality complex (MHC)      loss variants upon disease recurrence.      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To evaluate the post treatment phenotype and functionality of genetically modified T cells      isolated from peripheral blood and from tumor sites.      II. To assess changes in immunoscore, Tregs, Myeloid cell subsets, and antigen spreading in      peripheral blood and tumor site.      III. To assess the influence of demographic and disease molecular characteristics on      treatment outcomes of complete response (CR) and overall survival (OS).      OUTLINE:      COURSE 1: Patients receive decitabine IV daily over 1 hour on days -8 to Day -6,      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -4 and -3, and genetically engineered      NY-ESO-1-specific T lymphocytes IV and intraperitoneally (IP) on day 0. Followed by low-dose      IL-2 for 2 weeks from Day 1 to Day 14..      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly at 3-9 months, every 6      months for 4 years, and then annually for up to 15 years.    ",,"

","      Autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) with a      safety switch will be infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma      and leukemia. The patients will be monitored after infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T      cells for adverse events, persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and treatment      efficacy.      Objectives:      To evaluate the safety and the efficacy of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell therapy for      patients with B cell malignancies.      Eligibility:      Patients between 1 and 85 years of age, who have relapsed or refractory CD19-expressing      B-cell malignancies (leukemia or lymphoma) that have not responded to standard treatments.      Patients with a history of allogeneic stem cell transplant who meet all eligibility criteria      are eligible to participate.      Patients must have adequate organ functions.      Design:        -  Peripheral blood from patients will be collected for isolation of peripheral blood           mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which will be transduced with a lentiviral or retroviral           vector encoding anti-CD19 CAR containing a CD28 and a CD3 zeta as costimulatory domains           as well as a safety switch.        -  Patients will receive a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen to prepare their immune           system to accept modified T cells.        -  Patients will receive an infusion of their own modified T cells. They will remain in the           hospital to be monitored for adverse events until they have recovered from the           treatment.        -  Patients will have frequent follow-up visits to monitor the persistence of modified T           cells and efficacy of the treatment.    ","      Despite progress has been made to date in the treatment of patients with B cell malignancies,      including leukemia and lymphoma, many patients with relapsed or refractory diseases do not      respond to the standard treatments. It has been shown that anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells      may be an effective approach to treat the relapsed or refractory diseases. The procedure      involves collecting PBMCs from the patients and modifying the T cells to attack the malignant      B cells. In this trial, autologous T cells engineered to express an anti-CD19 chimeric      antigen receptor (CAR) containing the signaling domains of CD28 and CD3-zeta, and a safety      switch will be infused back to patients with B cell malignancies, including lymphoma and      leukemia. The patients will be pretreated with a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen      before the infusion of anti-CD19 CAR T cells, and will be monitored for adverse events,      persistence of anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells and the treatment efficacy.      OBJECTIVES:        -  Primary objectives        -  To determine the safety and feasibility of the administration of anti-CD19 CAR           transduced T cells in patients with CD19+ B-cell malignancies.        -  Secondary objectives:        -  To determine if the treatment regimen can result in clinical regression of B-cell           malignancies in the patients as described above.        -  To determine the in vivo persistency of the anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells.

Living donor/deceased donor kidney transplant recipients ≥6 months from time of                  transplant.               3. Diagnosis of CABMR determined by kidney biopsy and the presence of HLA DSA using                  single-antigen bead-based assays.                  NOTE: If conducted within 6 months (+3 weeks) of the start of the screening                  period, the biopsy and DSA analysis do not need to be repeated at screening. To                  be considered for determination of study eligibility, the biopsy and DSA analysis                  must be performed at least 2 months ± 2 weeks after the end of any prior                  treatment for ABMR (including CABMR) or TCMR, in order to show continuing CABMR                  and presence of HLA DSA. In addition, treatments for ABMR or TCMR are not allowed                  within 3 months of the start of screening.                  The following histopathologic and serologic diagnostic criteria (based on Banff                  2015 criteria [Loupy et al, 2017]) must be met for inclusion:                    -  Morphologic evidence of chronic tissue injury, as demonstrated by TG (cg>0).

NOTE: The local pathologist's diagnosis must be reviewed by a central pathologist                  to confirm eligibility for entry into the study. Biopsies with other                  histopathologic changes (eg, BKV nephropathy or recurrent glomerulonephritis) may                  be eligible if concurrent CABMR changes (as detailed above) are present and                  determined to be the predominant cause of renal dysfunction.               4. Serologic evidence of circulating DSA to HLA. NOTE: The local laboratory DSA                  results must be reviewed and confirmed by the central HLA reviewer during the                  screening period.          -  Exclusion criteria:               1. Multi-organ transplant recipient (except for simultaneous kidney-pancreas or                  previous multiple kidney transplants) or cell transplant (islet, bone marrow,                  stem cell) recipient.               2. Treatment for ABMR (including CABMR) or TCMR within 3 months of the start of                  screening.               3. Received T cell depleting agents (e.g., alemtuzumab, anti-thymocyte globulin)                  within 3 months of the start of screening.               4. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or unwillingness to practice adequate contraception.               5. History of active tuberculosis (TB).               6.

This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of      an investigational drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational      drug as a possible treatment for this diagnosis of recurrent or progressive brain tumor.    ","      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug as a possible      treatment for this diagnosis. ""Investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied.      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved rQNestin34.5v.2 as a      treatment for any disease. This is the first time that rQnestin34.5v.2 will be given to      humans.      The research drug, rQNestin34.5v.2, is an oncolytic viral vector made from the herpes simplex      virus type 1 (HSV1). The large majority of humans already have regular HSV1 in their nervous      system. Normally, this virus can cause cold sores in areas like the lips, fingers and      genitals in humans by making copies of itself in normal healthy cells. In some cases, HSV1      can cause severe infection of the brain and liver and/or death. However, scientists have      removed or changed parts of the rQNestin virus being used on this study so it can only make      copies of itself in glioma cells and not normal healthy cells.      If it is effective, the rQNestin34.5v.2 drug will spread to a glioma cell, kill it, and then      make a copy of itself and spread again. This should be repeated over and over until all      glioma cells are reached. If rQNestin34.5v.2 moves into a normal brain cell, it should not      grow and make copies, and therefore should not spread to other normal brain cells.      The purpose of this research study is to test if rQnestin34.5v.2 is safe to use in humans,      and if it is effective in treating malignant glioma. This study is also looking for the      highest dose of rQNestin34.5v.2 that can be given safely to people with malignant brain      tumors.    ",,"

","      This Phase I (Cohort I and Cohort II) and Phase II trial is designed to confirm the safety      and tolerability of Pembrolizumab when given in conjunction with M032, an oHSV that      ex-presses IL-12 and perform the Phase II portion using a Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of      M032 (provided by the Phase I) when given in conjunction with Pembrolizumab for recurrent      malignant glioma (glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or glio-sarcoma).    ","      Phase I/Cohort I:      For the Phase I portion of this trial, patients whose malignant gliomas recur after      undergoing initial surgical resection, standard of care radiotherapy (60Gy) and standard of      care temozolomide chemotherapy and who are candidates for, and would bene-fit from, a      surgical debulking. Patients whose tumors have unmethylated MGMT promoters who have completed      radiation therapy will also be eligible, regardless of whether or not they received      temozolomide, since some centers are not using temozolomide in these patients. M032 will      initially be administered directly into the tumor bed at the time of craniotomy and      immediately after resection of the tumor. Patients will be treated with a total dose of 1 x      106 pfu of M032 initially and then subsequently with each dose of Pembrolizumab. If one      toxicity occurs at a given dose level, that cohort will be increased to six patients. If two      or more toxicities occur at the 1 x 106 pfu dose level, then a new cohort will be enrolled at      1 x 105 pfu, using the same approach. If two or more toxicities occur at the 1 x 105 pfu dose      level, then the DSMB will be consulted to determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or      consideration of dose de-escalation to 1 x 104 pfu be considered. The highest safe dose will      be considered the starting dose for      Phase I/Cohort II. Details of initial dose administration of M032. Patients must be      candidates for a resection of the enhancing portion of the recurrent tumor; they will undergo      craniotomy, with additional burr holes as needed, and then stereotactic placement of up to 4      infusion catheters. Planned catheter tip locations will include: a) > 2.5 cm from a cortical      surface; b) > 1 cm from an ependymal surface or the margin of the planned resection cavity;      and c) if possible, > 0.5 cm from a sulcus. This will minimize loss of dose into the      subarachnoid or intra-ventricular space during subsequent M032 inoculations.      Only after catheters have been successfully placed (with Rickham reservoirs used to cap off      cathethers and hold them in place for the remainder of surgery) will patients will then      un-dergo resection of the enhancing portion of the tumor. Subsequent to the resection but      prior to dural closure, M032 will be administered if no ventricular entry has occurred during      the resection. M032 will be administered by by multiple free hand injections into the      resected tumor bed, using approximately equal volumes at each site (6 ml total). Each      inoculation will be administered ~1 cm apart and delivered into the resected tumor bed over 1      minute and at a 1 cm depth (28G, 1/2-inch needle fitted to a 1-cc tuberculin syringe), where      possible. Injections will be placed with careful avoidance of penetration of the ventricular      sys-tem or any significant vascular structures, and any of the already-placed catheters.      Intraoperative ultrasound will be used as needed to define positions of structures or      catheters to avoid. After each inoculation the needle will be left in place for up to two      minutes before removal and, after removal, the entry site will be covered with hemostatic      agent. Both of these measures should minimize reflux of inoculum back into the tumor cavity.      Before closing the dura, a fifth catheter will be left in place and then anchored with a      Rickham in the tumor resection cavity to allow later access for CSF collection. This Rickham      will not be used for M032 administration. The surgical procedure will then be completed in      standard fashion. If ventricular entry has occurred during surgery, no M032 will be      administered intraoperatively. Instead, a post-operative CT scan will be obtained on Day 1,      and the initial M032 dose will be administered as outlined below, using all catheters felt to      be appropriately positioned adjacent to the tumor cavity without violating the constraints of      the exclusion criteria.      Pembrolizumab treatment and subsequent treatments of M032. Starting at week four, patients      will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with intra-venous      infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1). A total of 3      combined doses of Pembrolizumab and M032 will be given. Patients will then undergo treatment      with inoculation of the calculated total dose of M032 as follows: each total dose (1 x 105      pfu for dose level one, 1 x 106 pfu for dose level two) directly into the remaining tumor bed      at the time of craniotomy and immediately after resection for a particular dose level will be      divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of catheters available for      inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of 0.5 ml of M032 and will      be infused over two minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir with a 22-24 g needle      (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the overlying scalp), followed by 0.5      ml of preservative free saline.      Determination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by      the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of      catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns      for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular      reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation. Catheters      whose reservoir(s) are closely associated with overlying scalp infections/inflammation will      not be injected. Each catheter will be gently aspirated after the Rickham has been accessed      but prior to M032 inoculation; catheters from which CSF can be aspirated will not be      inoculated to avoid inoculation into the CSF space. The MRI obtained immediately prior to      assessment (see schedule, below) will be used to help inform the decision-making above. If      there is any question regarding reservoir/catheter suitability, an additional CT or MRI may      be obtained prior to inoculation at the PI's discretion.      Combined Pembrolizumab and M032 treatments at each dose level will be repeated at three-week      intervals for up to three cycles total, or until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression      occurs. Patients who are responding to treatment may be considered for additional dosing      after the trial period has been completed.      The first two patients treated will not require any waiting period between enrollments. If      one of the two should develop a toxicity, the third and subsequent (up to six) patients at      that level will not be enrolled until seven weeks from the initial dose of M032 and three      weeks from the first combined dose of Pembrolizumab and M032 has transpired for the initial      two patients and every patient thereafter, to allow adequate duration of time for development      of potential dose limiting toxicities in each treated patient before treating the next      patient at that level.      Patients will undergo and then subsequently with each dose of Pembrolizumab; i If one      toxicity occurs at a given dose level, that cohort will be increased to 6 patients. If 2 or      more toxicities occur at the tested dose level, then with the approval of the DSMB, the dose      will be de-escalated by one log and a new cohort enrolled with similar rules at the level. If      2 or more toxicities occur at the de-escalated dose level, then the DSMB will be consulted to      determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or consideration of further dose de-escalation      should be considered. We anticipate as few as four patients (given two or more DLTs      initially) and as many as 12 (only one DLT at each dose level). However, based on experience      with M032 and Pembrolizumab, we expect that this combination will not pro-duce any      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).      Phase I/Cohort II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction      with Pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent MG, the trial will immediately transition into      a Phase I Cohort II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG.      Patients who are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and      are eligible for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort      trial. As in Phase I Cohort I, for the Phase I/Cohort II, consented subjects will have safe      gross total resection, implantation of up to four Rickham catheters in the peritumoral brain      and M032 injected into the wall of the resection cavity as described above.      Patients will be treated with a total dose of of M032 initially at the time of craniotomy as      determined in Cohort I, above. They will then undergo treatment with standard fractionated      radiation, and temozolomide as determined by treating physician. Starting at week four,      patients will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with      intra-venous infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1) and      intratumoral M032 (via the Rickham-catheters placed at the periphery of the tumor cavity-the      catheter left in the tumor cavity itself will not be used for M032 inoculation, but only to      access CSF). Patients will then undergo treatment with inoculation of the calculated total      dose of M032 for that dose level divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of      catheters available for inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of      0.5 ml of M032 and will be infused over 2 minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir      with a 22-24 g needle (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the over-lying      scalp).      Determination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by      the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of      catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns      for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular      reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation.

If      2 or more toxicities occur at the dd-escalated dose level, then the DSMB will be consulted to      determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or consideration of further dose de-escalation      should be considered. We anticipate as few as four patients (given two or more DLTs      initially) and as many as 12 (only one DLT at each dose level). However, based on experience      with M032 and Pembrolizumab, we expect that this combination will not pro-duce any      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).      Phase II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction with      Pembrolizumab in patients with newly-diagnosed MG, the trial will immediately transition into      a Phase II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG. Patients who      are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and are eligible      for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort trial. Dosing      will be administered using the RP2D established in the Phase I/Cohort II and administered      using the same regimen and schedule. However, unlike the Phase I, patients will be eligible      to receive Pembrolizumab and M032 every 3 weeks for up to one year. The Phase II design will      employ the Simon two-stage optimal study design. It will be a single-arm open-label study of      M032+ pembrolizumab and the primary endpoints of Over-all Survival at 12 months and 24      months, and Progression Free Survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6). We will use the iRANO      criteria for MRI-defined changes indicative of pseudopro-gression, suggesting a beneficial      inflammatory immune response. In the first stage, 6 patients will be accrued. Data will be      allowed to mature, and an interim analysis per-formed at that time. During this period,      additional subjects may be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in the initial 6      patients, further accrual to the study may be stopped. Otherwise, 10 additional patients will      be accrued for a total of 16. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more responses      are observed in 16 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 80%      when the PFS6 is 75%. To allow for 25% unevaluable subjects, a maximum of 22 subjects will be      enrolled.    ",,"

","Overall Survival at 12 and 24 months and Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6)6-24 monthsOverall Survival at 12 and 24 months allows for a quantifiable outcome that should be straightforward to compare to historical data in this patient population. PFS-6 evaluates all treated patients at 6 months after baseline MRI and determines the percentage of patients who have not progressed by either imaging or neurologic evaluation. The iRA-NO criteria will be utilized to determine progression for this trial. PFS-6 will also be com-pared to historical controls for each cohort., Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS)3 yearsOS will be determined for each cohort of patients and compared to historical controls for that cohort. PFS will be determined by MRI and neurologic evaluation using the iRANO criteria. PFS utilizes an historical approach to determining if progression has occurred and is helpful measure to compare this current study to historical studies. An im-portant limitation in the assessment of PFS centers on the fact that patients may not get im-aging or neurologic examinations done at an optimal or consistent time; as such, another approach, PFS-6, has been adopted in some studies. PFS-6 evaluates all treated patients at 6 months after baseline MRI and determines the percentage of patients who have not pro-gressed by either imaging or neurologic evaluation. The iRANO criteria will be utilized to determine progression for this trial. PFS and OS will be compared to historical controls for each cohort.",,"

","        Inclusion Criteria:        Phase I/Cohort I: Participants are eligible to be included in the study only if all of the        following criteria apply:        Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme,        anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma, and is deemed a potential candidate for resection        of the recurrent tumor.        Prior therapy: Patients must have failed external beam radio-therapy to the brain, and if        eligible and tolerated, undergone appropriate treatment with temozolomide chemotherapy. All        radiation and additional chemotherapies must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to        enrollment. Prior therapy with nitrosoureas must have been completed at least 6 weeks prior        to enrollment.        Phase I/Cohort II or Phase II: Participants are eligible to be included in the study only        if all of the following criteria apply:        Patient must have MRI findings consistent with probable malignant glioma, have no previous        diagnosis of glioma, and have had either no history of any surgery for brain tumor. The        exception to this requirement is that patients who have under-gone biopsy for diagnosis        only and have not received any other treatment. All patients must be potential candidates        for resection of the probably malignant glioma tumor.        Should a patient in Phase I/Cohort II or Phase II be found on final pathologic diagnosis to        not have a glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma, he/she will        receive no other doses of M032 other than that administered at the time of craniotomy, nor        will he/she receive any doses of Pembrolizumab. He/she will be followed for evidence of        toxicity of M032 only and will be considered off-study for all efficacy and other secondary        endpoints.        All newly diagnosed patients, whether in Phase I/Cohort II or Phase II shall also be        required to meet the following eligibility and be subject to the exclusion criteria below:          1. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the             use of M032 in patients <16 years of age, children are excluded from this study but             will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.          2. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70% (see Appendix B).          3. Life expectancy of greater than 4 weeks.          4. Preoperatively, the lesion must be ≥1.0 cm in diameter as determined by MRI.          5. The effects of M032 on the developing human fetus are unknown.

The study will      enroll subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 using a modified 3+3 cell dose escalation      design, to evaluate dose limiting toxicities and determine the target cell dose range.      Following the dose escalation phase, additional subjects will be enrolled at the target cell      dose range to further characterize safety and the effects at this cell dose.      The study will take the subject's T cells, which are a natural type of immune cell in the      blood, and send them to a laboratory to be modified. The changed T cells used in this study      will be the subject's own T cells that have been genetically changed with the aim of      attacking and destroying cancer cells. When the MAGE-A10ᶜ⁷⁹⁶T cells are available, subjects      will undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by      T cell infusion. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of genetically changed T      cells and find out what effects, if any, they have in subjects with urothelial, melanoma or      head and neck cancer.      Subjects will be seen frequently by the Study Physician after receiving their T cells for the      next 6 months. After that, subjects will be seen every 3, 6, or 12 months according to the      Schedule of Procedures. All subjects completing or withdrawing from the interventional      portion of the study will enter a long term follow-up phase for observation of delayed      adverse events and overall survival for 15 years post-infusion.

","      The study consists of three parts: a single ascending dose escalation of IT VSV-IFNβ-NIS      monotherapy, a monotherapy IV regimen selection phase and an expansion phase, designed to      explore the safety and efficacy of the chosen monotherapy regimen alone or in combination      with avelumab in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Monotherapy will also be      explored in patients with pheochromocytoma and NET.      Patients are required to have at least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST 1.1, and in the      IT-containing arms this lesion should be amenable for a one-time IT injection of      VSV-IFNβ-NIS. At least one patient per IT cohort is required to have at least 2 measurable      lesions per RECIST 1.1, one for a one-time IT injection of VSV-IFNβ-NIS and one to be used as      a control. Priority enrollment in the IT-containing arms will be granted to patients with 2      measurable lesions per RECIST 1.1. At least one patient per dose level should have metastatic      colorectal cancer. In order to fulfil these requirements, at least 3 or 4 patients will be      required per escalation dose cohort. Other tumor types of particular interest based on prior      experience with VSV or oncolytic viruses include malignant melanoma and endometrial cancer.

","      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of recombinant vesicular stomatitis      virus carrying the human NIS and IFN beta genes (VSV-hIFNbeta-sodium iodide symporter [NIS])      with or without ruxolitinib phosphate in treating patients with multiple myeloma, acute      myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma that has come back or does not respond to treatment. A      virus, called VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, which has been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill      cancer cells without damaging normal cells. Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS      and ruxolitinib phosphate may work better at treating multiple myeloma, acute myeloid      leukemia and T-cell lymphoma.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in different treatment      regimens (alone [group A] and in combination with ruxolitinib phosphate [ruxolitinib] [group      B]) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia, or T-cell      lymphoma and in combination with ruxolitinib and cyclophosphamide (group C) in      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the safety profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with      ruxolitinib).      II. To estimate clinical response rate of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with      ruxolitinib) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute myeloid leukemia,      or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.      III. To estimate progression-free and overall survival of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in      combination with ruxolitinib) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, acute      myeloid leukemia, or T-cell lymphoma overall and by disease type.      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with      VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS using planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed      tomography (CT) imaging.      II. To assess virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in urine and respiratory secretions,      and virus persistence after systemic administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS.      III. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum      interferon-beta and also vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-real time (RT)-polymerase chain      reaction (PCR) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.      IV. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK)      cell responses.      V. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. VI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor      and normal tissues subsequent to administration of intravenous (IV) VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.      VII. To identify the best dose of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in the regimen being evaluated based on      activity observed in the correlative measures described above in those dose levels identified      as tolerable.      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3      groups.      GROUP A: Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.      Patients undergo SPECT/CT scans at baseline, and at days 3 and 8 after VSV-IFNbeta-NIS      infusion.      GROUP B: Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib      phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 9. Patients undergo SPECT/CT scans at      baseline, and at days 3 and 8 after VSV-IFNbeta-NIS infusion.      GROUP C: Patients receive VSV-IFNbeta-NIS IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and ruxolitinib      phosphate PO BID on days -1 to 9. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on      day 2. Patients undergo SPECT/CT scans at baseline, and at days 3 and 8 after VSV-IFNbeta-NIS      infusion.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days, and then every 3      months for up to 1 year or until progressive disease, then every 6 months for 1 year.    ",,"

","      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vesicular stomatitis virus-human      interferon beta-sodium iodide symporter (VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS) with or without ruxolitinib      phosphate in treating patients with stage IV endometrial cancer or endometrial cancer that      has come back. The study virus, VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS, has been changed so that it has restricted      ability to spread to tumor cells and not to healthy cells. It also contains a gene for a      protein, NIS, which helps the body concentrate iodine making it possible to track where the      virus goes. VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.      Ruxolitinib phosphate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes      needed for cell growth. Giving VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS with ruxolitinib phosphate may work better in      treating patients with endometrial cancer compared to VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS alone.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To evaluate the optimal dose schedule, safety and tolerability as measured by the      incidence of significant toxicity of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS in immunocompetent patients with      metastatic and/or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC).      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the toxicity profile of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with      ruxolitinib phosphate [ruxolitinib]).      II. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with      VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib) using Tc-99m pertechnetate      planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) or      fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate (TFB)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.      III. To assess virus replication, viremia; viral shedding in urine and respiratory      secretions; and virus persistence after intravenous (IV) administration of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS      (alone and in combination with ruxolitinib).      IV. To monitor humoral responses to the injected virus. V. To estimate the tumor response      rate and overall survival.      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS in patients with EC by      measurement of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS in blood by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction      (RT-PCR).      II. To characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS by way of measuring serum      interferon-beta and also VSV-RT-PCR of VSV-IFNbeta-NIS listed above.      III. Assess CD8+ T cell (both general and VSV-IFNbeta-NIS specific) and natural killer (NK)      cell responses.      IV. Gene expression analysis pre- and post-virotherapy. V. Evaluate transcription of      interferon mediated genes (protein kinase R, the death receptor-TRAIL, 2'-5'      oligoadenylate/RNAse L proteins, heat shock proteins [Hsp 60/70/90], major histocompatibility      class antigens and IRF-7).      VI. Assess presence of VSV in tumor and normal tissues subsequent to administration of IV      VSV-IFNbeta-NIS.      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS. Patients are randomized to 1 of      2 arms.      ARM A: Patients receive VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. After 2 days,      patients receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV, and about 30 minutes later,      undergo whole body planar imaging and SPECT/CT imaging or receive fluorine F18      tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo TFB-PET imaging. If previous imaging data are positive,      patients receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV and undergo another planar and      SPECT/CT imaging or fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo another TFB-PET imaging      between 7-10 days and on 15 days if needed after VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS infusion. Biopsy of      accessible NIS image-positive tumors may occur after any imaging. Patients also undergo      image-guided biopsy of accessible tumor on day 29.      ARM B: Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 9.      Patients also receive VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. After 2 days, patients      receive technetium Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV, and about 30 minutes later, undergo whole      body planar imaging and SPECT/CT imaging or receive fluorine F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and      undergo TFB-PET imaging. If previous imaging data are positive, patients receive technetium      Tc-99m sodium pertechnetate IV and undergo another planar and SPECT/CT imaging or fluorine      F18 tetrafluoroborate IV and undergo another TFB-PET imaging between 7-10 days and on 15 days      if needed after VSV-hIFNbeta-NIS infusion. Biopsy of accessible NIS image-positive tumors may      occur after any imaging. Patients also undergo image-guided biopsy of accessible tumor on day      29.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at day 29, every 3 months until      disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.    ",,"

","      Background:      - One experimental treatment for certain types of cancer is cell therapy, which involves      collecting lymphocytes (white blood cells) from a tumor, growing them in the laboratory in      large numbers, and then modifying the cells with a gene (interleukin-12 (IL-12)) that      stimulates the immune system to attack and destroy the cancer cells. Because this treatment      is experimental, researchers are interested in determining the side effects and overall      effectiveness of cell therapy using white blood cells modified with IL-12 as a treatment for      aggressive cancer.      Objectives:      - To determine the safety and effectiveness of cell therapy using IL-12 modified tumor white      blood cells to treat metastatic melanoma.      Eligibility:      - Individuals greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 66 who      have been diagnosed with metastatic melanoma.      Design:        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and           urine tests, and imaging studies.        -  Cells for treatment will be collected during tumor biopsy or surgery.        -  Prior to the start of cell therapy, participants will have imaging procedures, heart and           lung function tests, and blood and urine tests, as well as leukapheresis to collect           additional white blood cells.        -  For 5 days before the cell infusion, participants will be admitted for inpatient           chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to suppress the immune system in           preparation for the cell therapy.        -  Participants will receive the modified white blood cells as an infusion 1 to 4 days           after the last dose of chemotherapy. The day after the infusion, participants will           receive filgrastim to stimulate blood cell growth.        -  Participants will remain as inpatients for at least 5 to 10 days to recover from the           treatment, and will be followed regularly after the treatment to study side effects and           general effectiveness.        -  Participants who initially respond to treatment but have a relapse may have one           additional treatment using the same procedure.    ","      Background:        -  Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an important immunostimulatory cytokine. We have constructed a           retroviral vector that contains an inducible single chain IL-12 driven by an nuclear           factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) responsive promoter which can be used to mediate           transfer of this gene into anti-tumor lymphocytes. This construct enables the secretion           of IL-12 following stimulation of the T cell receptor.        -  Transduction of the IL-12 gene into mouse anti-tumor lymphocytes results in a profound           increase in the ability of these lymphocytes to mediate tumor regression following           administration to tumor bearing mice. These cells have a profound advantage in inducing           anti-tumor responses because very few cells are needed and there is no requirement for           the concomitant administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as is the case for conventional           cell transfer immunotherapies.        -  Based on these murine studies we have now constructed a similar retrovirus that contains           an inducible human single chain IL-12 driven by an NFAT responsive promoter. This           retrovirus can be used to transduce tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) suitable for           the therapy of patients with metastatic melanoma.      Objectives:      Primary objectives:        -  To evaluate the safety of the administration of IL-12 engineered TIL in patients           receiving a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.        -  Determine if the administration of IL-12 engineered TIL to patients following a           non-myeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical           tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer.      Secondary objective:      -Determine the in vivo survival of IL-12 gene-engineered cells.      Eligibility:      Patients who are 18 years of age or older must have:        -  metastatic melanoma;        -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1;      Design:        -  TIL will be resected from metastatic deposits and grown in IL-2 using standard           techniques.        -  Prior to approval of amendment A, after about 2 weeks TIL will undergo cluster of           differentiation 8 (CD8) enrichment on a Miltenyi column and then undergo a rapid           expansion by exposure to Muromoanb-CD3) OKT-3 an IL-2 in the presence irradiated feeder           cells. Four to five days later, transduction is initiated by addition of retroviral           vector supernatant containing the IL-12 gene.      With approval of amendment A, TIL will not undergo CD8 enrichment. Starting with cohort 5,      after initial growth, TIL undergo a rapid expansion by exposure to OKT-3 and IL-2 in the      presence irradiated feeder cells. Four to five days later, transduction is initiated by      addition of retroviral vector supernatant containing the IL-12 gene.        -  Patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen           consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of IL-12           gene-transduced TIL. Cohorts of 3 patients each will receive increasing cell doses.        -  Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, computed           tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four           to six weeks after treatment. If the patient has stable disease (SD) or tumor shrinkage,           repeat complete evaluations will be performed every 1-3 months. After the first year,           patients continuing to respond will continue to be followed with this evaluation every           3-4 months until off study criteria are met.        -  The study will be conducted using a Phase I/II optimal design. The protocol will proceed           in a phase 1 dose escalation design.        -  Prior to approval of amendment A, the protocol enrolled 1 patient in each of the first 3           dose cohorts. Cohort 4 proceeded in a phase 1 dose escalation design, with of n=3.           Should a single patient experience a dose limiting toxicity due to the cell transfer at           a particular dose level, additional patients would be treated at that dose to confirm           that no greater than 1/6 patients have a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) prior to           proceeding to the next higher level. If a level with 2 or more DLTs in 3-6 patients has           been identified, three additional patients will be accrued at the next- lowest dose, for           a total of 6, in order to further characterize the safety of the maximum tolerated dose.        -  With approval of amendment A, no additional patients will be enrolled in cohort 4, and           the protocol will enroll 1 patient in cohort 5 with a dose of 1 X 10^7 bulk young TIL           cells. Cohorts 6-12 will proceeded in a phase 1 dose escalation design, with an n=3.           Should a single patient experience a dose limiting toxicity due to the cell transfer at           a particular dose level, additional patients would be treated at that dose to confirm           that no greater than 1/6 patients have a DLT prior to proceeding to the next higher           level. If a level with 2 or more DLTs in 3-6 patients has been identified, three           additional patients will be accrued at the next-lowest dose, for a total of 6, in order           to further characterize the safety of the maximum tolerated dose prior to starting the           pahse II portion. If a dose limiting toxicity occurs in the cohort 4, that cohort will           be expanded to 6 patients. If 2 DLTs are encountered in this cohort, the study will be           terminated.        -  Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined, the study then would proceed           to the phase II portion using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable           patients will be enrolled. If 0 or 1 of the 21 patients experiences a clinical response,           then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable           patients enrolled have a clinical response, then accrual will continue until a total of           41 evaluable patients have been enrolled.        -  The objective will be to determine if the combination of lymphocyte depleting           chemotherapy, and IL-12 gene engineered lymphocytes is associated with a clinical           response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% partial response           (PR) + complete response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).

","Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)4 yearsThe MTD was determined by evaluating dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of participants that received increasing doses of intravenous infusion of IL-12 gene transduced tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (i.e., 1x10^6, 3x10^6, 3x10^7, 1x10^7, 3x10^7, 1x10^8, 3x10^8, 1x10^9, and 3x10^9) in cohorts 1-10. Maximum tolerated cell dose is the highest dose at which </= 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT (i.e. grade 2 or greater allergic reaction))., Response (Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR)) to Therapy4 yearsResponse was determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.0. Complete response (CR) is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the baseline um LD. Progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more lesions.","

","      This randomized phase II trial studies how well oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal      sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) compared to investigator's choice chemotherapy works in      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian, or peritoneal cancer. Measles virus, which has      been changed in a certain way, may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. Compare clinical efficacy of Arm A (MV-NIS therapy) and Arm B (standard cytotoxic      chemotherapy), as measured by overall survival (OS).      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. Compare progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival at 12 months (OS12),      progression-free survival at six months (PFS6), and objective response rate (ORR) between      MV-NIS therapy and standard chemotherapy.      II. Assess safety and tolerability of MV-NIS, and compare with standard chemotherapy.      III. Compare quality of life as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian      (FACT-O) between MV-NIS and standard chemotherapy.      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:      I. Assess the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and biodistribution      of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS using      single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging      within the MV-NIS treatment arm.      II. Assess viremia, viral replication, and viral shedding/persistence following      intraperitoneal administration within the NV-NIS treatment arm.      III. Measure humoral and cellular immune responses to MV-NIS within the NV-NIS treatment arm.      IV. Measure changes in anti-ovarian cancer (OC) immune responses in both treatment arms.      V. Perform transcriptomic analysis on tumor biopsy specimens to determine a gene expression      profile predictive of therapeutic response to MV-NIS.      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.      ARM A: Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter      intraperitoneally (IP) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.      ARM B: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over      1 hour on day 1, or gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or      topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, or paclitaxel IV over 1 hour      on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1      and 15 with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, topotecan hydrochloride, or      paclitaxel. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable      toxicity.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months until disease      progression and then every 6 months for 5 years.    ",,"

","      This is an open-label, single site study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of      intratumoral administration of G207 followed by treatment with radiation therapy in patients      with recurrent/progressive malignant glioma.      This study is a two stage phase 1 study, in which a de-escalating dosing scheme will be used,      i.e. the first patients will receive the higher dose and if excessive toxicity occurs, the      dose will be reduced for the following patients. The purpose of the dose de-escalation phase      is to find the best safe dose of G207.      In the first stage of the study, treatment with G207 will be followed by focal radiation      therapy on the following day, and in the second stage treatment with G207 will be followed by      gamma knife surgery also on the following day.      All patients will return to the clinic 28 days and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after G207      administration at which time clinical assessments will be performed, and will be followed for      safety and survival at clinic visits or by telephone every 3 months for up to 2 additional      years and annually thereafter.

The virus has been altered by having an extra gene (piece of DNA) added to it to      allow a protein called NIS to be inserted into it. NIS is normally found in the thyroid gland      ( a small gland in the neck) and helps the body concentrate iodine. Having this additional      gene will make it possible to track where the virus goes in the body.    ,,"

","      At present, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) remains a major health threat in immune compromised      patients. Especially HCMV will cause blind and death in HIV-1 infected person. Currently, few      antiviral drugs can be chosen for treatment of HCMV infection. Besides, more and more drug      resistant virus strains were reported and led failure in antiviral therapy.      Various diagnostic methods are available for CMV infection. Such as shell vial assay, CMV      antigen test, pp65 antigen assay and polymerase chain reaction. But none of them could be a      standard and highly valuable. Although CMV-PCR is very sensitive, it can't distinguish      between active disease and asymptomatic infection or latency, can't predict symptomatic      disease nor can't monitor the successful antiviral therapy.

","      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy when given      with or without cyclophosphamide and to see how well they work in treating patients with      multiple myeloma that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to previous treatment      (refractory). Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective      immune response to kill cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide,      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving vaccine therapy      together with cyclophosphamide may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oncolytic measles virus encoding      thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) when administered with or without cyclophosphamide      in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the      confirmed response rate of MV-NIS alone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple      myeloma who have exhausted all therapeutic options. (Phase II, Cohort A) III. To evaluate the      confirmed response rate of MV-NIS alone in patients who are relapsing from very good partial      response (VGPR) or complete response (CR) and have not received myeloma directed therapy for      at least 12 weeks. (Phase II, Cohort B)      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of the intravenous administration of an Edmonston      vaccine strain measles virus engineered to express the thyroidal sodium iodide symporter      (MV-NIS) when administered with or without cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or      refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To evaluate the confirmed response rate of MV-NIS      in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) III. To further evaluate      the adverse event profile of MV-NIS in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.      (Phase II) IV. To evaluate overall survival, failure-free survival and progression-free      survival. (Phase II)      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination, and the      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various times points after infection with MV-NIS      (when administered with or without cyclophosphamide) using 99m-technetium (Tc) gamma camera      imaging. (Phase I and II) II. To assess virus replication, viremia, viral shedding in urine      and respiratory secretions, and virus persistence after systemic administration of MV-NIS      (when administered with or without cyclophosphamide). (Phase I and II) III. To monitor      humoral responses to the injected virus. (Phase I and II) IV. To explore the anti-myeloma      efficacy (i.e. clinical response rate, time to progression, progression free survival,      duration of response) of the virus using standard myeloma response criteria as well as      immunoglobulin free light chain measurements. (Phase I and II)      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of MV-NIS followed by a phase II study.

","      RATIONALE: A gene-modified virus may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal      cells.      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of an attenuated      oncolytic measles virus therapy and oncolytic virus therapy in treating patients with      progressive, recurrent, or refractory ovarian epithelial cancer or primary peritoneal cancer      (measles virus vaccine therapy study closed as of 06/02/2008).    ","      OBJECTIVES:        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen           (CEA)-expressing measles virus (MV-CEA) and oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal           sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) in patients with progressive, recurrent, or refractory           ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer ( MV-CEA closed as of           06/02/2008).        -  Determine the maximum-tolerated dose of MV-CEA and MV-NIS in these patients ( MV-CEA           closed as of 06/02/2008).        -  Characterize viral gene expression at each dose level as manifested by CEA titers in           these patients.        -  Assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding or persistence after study           therapy.        -  Determine humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus in these patients.        -  Assess, preliminarily, the antitumor efficacy of this therapy, by assessing CA-125           levels, radiographic response, and time to progression, in these patients.        -  Determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and           biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with           MV-NIS using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging.        -  Assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following           intraperitoneal administration of MV-NIS.      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.      Patients receive recombinant carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing measles virus (MV-CEA) or      oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter (MV-NIS) intraperitoneally      over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity ( MV-CEA closed as of 06/02/2008).      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MV-CEA until the maximum tolerated dose      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity ( MV-CEA closed as of 06/02/2008).      Peripheral blood mononuclear cells are collected at baseline and periodically during and      after treatment to assess viremia. Throat gargle and urine specimens are assessed      periodically during course 1 for viral shedding by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain      reaction (RT-PCR). Peritoneal aspirate is tested at baseline and periodically during      treatment for viral replication by RT-PCR, co-culture with Vero cells, and measles virus      N-specific mRNA in situ hybridization.      Patients may undergo single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging at      baseline and periodically during study.      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 15 years.      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study.    ",,"

Number of Responses (Complete and Partial, Stable and Progressive Disease)
up to 12 months after last treatment
Responses will be summarized separately for the MV-CEA virus and MV-NIS virus by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease. CA125 levels and time to progression will also be summarized descriptively. Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors(RECIST v1.0) criteria will be used. For target lesions: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), >=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter(LD) of target lesions; Progression (PD): As least a 20% increase in the sum of LD of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as references the smallest sum LD

",,"      This clinical trial will study the safety and effectiveness of an engineered herpes virus,      G207, administered directly into the brain of patients with recurrent brain cancer. G207 has      been modified from the herpes virus that causes cold sores (called herpes simplex virus type      1 or HSV-1). G207 has been designed so that it should kill tumor cells, but not harm normal      brain cells. G207 has been shown to be safe in animal testing completed to date and in      previous studies in patients with brain tumors.      This is a phase Ib/II study. In the phase Ib portion of the study, patients will receive G207      at a dose that is higher than tested in previous human studies. Patients will initially      receive 15% of the assigned dose injected directly into the brain tumor. Approximately two      days later, as much of the tumor as possible will be surgically removed, and more G207 will      be injected into the brain tumor bed. Patients will be monitored, and medical tests will be      done at specific study timepoints.      The phase II portion will begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion.      The goals of the phase II portion of the study are to determine the safety of G207 and to      study patient survival at six months after G207 dosing. In the phase II portion of the study,      patients will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose determined to be safe in the      phase Ib portion of the study. The tumor will be removed, and G207 will be injected into any      remaining tumor tissue in the brain tumor bed. Patients will be closely monitored, medical      tests will be performed at specific study visits, and survival will be evaluated.    ","      Protocol NG1-003 is an open-label, phase Ib/II study of the safety and efficacy of G207, a      genetically engineered herpes simplex type-1 virus. Up to 21 patients will be enrolled in the      phase Ib portion and will receive doses of G207 that are higher than tested in the previous      trials. The highest G207 dose tested in a previous phase I trial (NG1-001) was 3E9 plaque      forming units (pfu). G207 was generally well tolerated and safe in NG1-001, and there was no      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients' deaths were due to progressive cancer disease except for      one (due to radiation necrosis), and two patients remain alive today.      Patients in the phase Ib portion of NG1-003 will receive G207 in divided doses. Initially,      15% of the assigned dose will be injected into the tumor. Two days later, the tumor will be      removed, and the assigned dose of G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of      resection. The assigned doses are as follows: 1E9, 3E9, and 1E10 pfu. Patient status will be      followed by MRI, Karnofsky performance, neurologic examination and the presence of G207 virus      in the body, in addition to other medical tests done at specific study visits.      The phase II portion of protocol NG1-003 is a two-stage study. The phase II portion will      begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion. The goals are to      determine the safety of G207 and survival at six months. Enrollment of up to 14 patients is      planned for stage one. Additional patients will be enrolled (up to 30 additional patients and      44 overall) in stage II if at least 6 of the 14 patients in stage 1 survive 6 months or      longer. Participants in phase II will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose      determined to be safe from phase Ib. G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of      resection. Again, patient status will be followed as previously described and survival will      be evaluated.    ",,"

","      The primary aim of this open-label, randomized control trial is to compare the immunogenicity      at week 28 after 20µg HBV vaccine (at week 0, 4, 24) versus 40µg HBV vaccine (40-µg at week      0, 4, 24 week) among HIV-positive patients or HIV-negative MSM who were born in Taiwan after      July 1986 and tested negative for all HBV serological markers. The secondary aims are to      assess the safety of double-dose HBV vaccination, the proportions of high-level responders      (anti-HBs antibody >100 mIU/ml) at weeks 28 and 48, the serological responses at week 48, and      incident HBV infection (indicated by appearance of anti-HBc and/or HBsAg) at week 48.    ","      I. Study procedures:        1. Well explain, complete inform and consent documents        2. A blood test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), anti-hepatitis B surface antibody           (anti-HBs antibody), anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc antibody), anti-HCV and           RPR will be performed first.        3. The patients with all negative seromarkers (within 1 month) will be allocated to two           groups (random blank=4), a standard-dose booster of 20µg and a double-dose booster of           40µg. For patients receiving 40µg, two 20µg of vaccines are injected at both sides of           deltoid muscles. The schedules of booster vaccination are the same in two groups, which           is at 0, 1, 6 months.        4. To detect and manage possible immediate and severe allergic reaction, patients who           received vaccination will be observed for 30 minutes after injection.        5. The solicited adverse effect will be recorded on the diary card if occurred in 7 days           after each dose of vaccination.        6. The titer of hepatitis B surface antibody will be examined before booster vaccination,           at the 4th week, the 24th week, 28th week, 48th week. By comparing the responses in the           two groups, the effect of different doses of booster vaccination can be evaluated. For           those HIV-negative individuals at baseline, HIV screening test will be evaluated every 6           months during the study, at the 24th week, the 48th.        7. To screen the acquisition of hepatitis B, the anti-HBc antibody and HBsAg will be           examined at the 48th week        8. To screen the acquisition of hepatitis C and syphilis, anti-HCV and RPR will be examined           at the 24th week, the 48th week        9.

","      The purpose of this study is to determine whether GL-ONC1, an attenuated vaccinia virus, is      safe when administered to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis via an infusion within the      abdominal cavity through an implanted catheter. The study seeks also to arrive at a      recommended dose and schedule for future investigations, evidence of anti-tumor activity,      detection of virus in body fluids, analysis of viral delivery to tumor and normal cells, and      to evaluate if there is an antibody response to vaccinia virus.    ","      Peritoneal carcinomatosis includes a variety of tumors with extensive metastasis throughout      the peritoneal cavity (inside surface of the abdomen) and can be found with gall bladder,      liver, colon, appendix, ovarian, pancreas, mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, rectal,      small bowel and stomach cancers. It broadly includes multiple tumors that develop in and line      the peritoneal abdominal cavity and linings. These tumors may be difficult to completely      remove surgically and may recur despite conventional systemic chemotherapy, thereby resulting      in poor patient outcomes. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, an oncolytic vaccinia virus, has      shown the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30      different human tumors. A Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of      GL-ONC1 intravenously administered to patients with a variety of solid tumor entities has      shown that GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of      antitumor activity. This additional Phase I/II study seeks to evaluate GL-ONC1 administered      repetitively every 4 weeks up to 4 cycles via infusion using an implanted catheter in the      peritoneal cavity. In Phase I, patients will be individually assessed for safety and dose      limiting toxicity. The study aims of Phase II portion are continued collection of safety      information to better define the tolerability of GL-ONC1, as well as viral replication and      the action or effect of GL-ONC1 in humans at the selected dose level and dosing schedule for      future trials. Throughout both phases of the study, anti-tumor effects will be evaluated.    ",,"

This 24 month (n=10) pilot study will extend the prior 2 month observation      tests towards the goal of assessing the safety of Leukine for treatment of Parkinson's      disease (PD). Clinical signs and symptoms will be measured by personal well-being, physical,      and neurological examinations (UPDRS Parts I, II, III, and IV assessments) and blood tests      (CBC with differential, total T cell count, and a comprehensive metabolic sera panel).      Second, we will assess regimen tolerability administered in a dose reduction, from 6      µg/kg/day without interruption, to 3 µg/kg/day with 2 day drug holidays. The investigators      will examine over a time of 24 months, effects of treatment on defined adaptive immune      deficits in PD as measured by analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected      before, during, and after cessation of Leukine administration. Individual T cell parameters      will be assessed and will include links between T cell function and subset analyses and      clinical neurological signs and symptoms. In addition, the functional stability of the immune      deficits will be assess in PD by examining T cell subsets in PD patients in this study      against prior results. The investigators will also determine whether the immune deficits of      PD are consistent during baseline data collection, and the potential Leukine-induced motor      control and mobility improvements will be determined by UPDRS part I, II, III, and IV scores      off treatment and on treatment.    ","      Primary Objectives: There are three study goals. First, the investigators will determine the      safety of a 24 month regimen of Leukine administered as a weight-based dose at 3 µg/kg/day      for 5 days (week), followed by a 2-day holiday (weekend). This 24 month (n=10) pilot study      will extend the prior 2 month observation tests towards the goal of assessing the safety of      Leukine for treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Clinical signs and symptoms will be      measured by personal well-being, physical, and neurological examinations (UPDRS Parts I, II,      III, and IV assessments) and blood tests (CBC with differential, total T cell count, and a      comprehensive metabolic sera panel). Second, the investigators will assess regimen      tolerability administered in a dose reduction, from 6 µg/kg/day without interruption, to 3      µg/kg/day with 2 day drug holidays. The lowered dose was chosen based on known tolerability      and parallel-linked immune reconstitution seen in cancer-associated disease treatments. Due      to fragility of the patient population and prior recorded adverse events the proposed dose      reductions are justified.      Secondary Objectives:      Over a course of 24 months, the effects of treatment on defined adaptive immune deficits in      PD as measured by analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected before, during,      and after cessation of Leukine administration will be examined. Individual T cell parameters      that include links between T cell function and subset analyses and clinical neurological      signs and symptoms will be examined. These immune parameters will be serially examined as      they may contribute to the immune deficits in PD. Thus, timed analyses of changes in T cell      phenotypes and/or function will be completed. In addition, the investigators will assess the      functional stability of the immune deficits in PD and will determine whether the immune      deficits of PD are consistent during baseline data collection. The potential Leukine-induced      motor control and mobility improvements will be determined by assessing UPDRS part I, II,      III, and IV scores off treatment and on treatment. Specifically, over the course of this      six-month treatment study, various biomarkers will be assessed including: T cell markers of      immune activation, DNA methylation status, and B cell and bone marrow progenitor cell      markers. We hope to uncover the time course of Treg induction, as well as link the      pharmacokinetics of Leukine treatment (not previously recorded) to changes in specific      biomarkers. Additionally, changes in the humoral response following extended Leukine      treatment will be assessed by measuring the presence of antibodies against Leukine and      alterations in B cell frequencies.

","      This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety profile of a type of immune therapy called      HER2 CAR T cells (short for HER2 chimeric antigen receptor T cells). In addition to looking      for side effects, we will study how well this treatment works against a brain tumor called      ependymoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent) or has not responded well to      treatment (progressive) in children. The HER2 CAR T cells used in this trial are made from      the patient's own blood. A new gene, called the HER2 CAR, will be inserted into patient's T      cells to allow them recognize a protein on the tumor called HER2. These HER2-specific CAR T      cells may be able to target and kill ependymoma tumors that express HER2. This research is      also studying how doable it is to provide this type of CAR T cell treatment to children being      treated at different hospitals.    ","      PBTC-059 is a multicenter, Phase I and Surgical study of the treatment HER2-specific CAR T      cells for patients with refractory or recurrent ependymoma.      Phase I      The primary objectives of the Phase I study are to determine the safety of intravenous      injection of HER2-specific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and to evaluate      the multicenter feasibility of administering up to three infusions of HER2-CAR T cells after      lymphodepletion.      Patients will receive one infusion of HER2psecific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting      chemotherapy. Following recovery from their first treatment (no earlier than 8 weeks and no      later than 12 weeks), patients will resume treatment with HER2-specific CAR T cells for up to      2 infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy if they meet laboratory parameters.      The length of time on study for patients enrolled on the Phase I study is anticipated to be 9      months on treatment. Patients will then be followed for 15 years after treatment.      Surgical Study      The objective of the Surgical study is to evaluate the post-treatment tumor tissue for      presence of HER2-specific CAR T cells administered intravenously in children undergoing      surgical resection. The surgical study will be initiated following completion of the safety      evaluation period of 6 patients treated in the Phase I study.      Once the surgical study is open for enrollment, all patients who have clinical indication for      surgery, except those needing urgent surgery, will be eligible for enrollment to the surgical      study. Patients will receive one infusion of HER2-specific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting      chemotherapy 4-6 weeks before surgical resection of their tumor, at which time samples will      be taken for analysis. Following recovery from surgery (no earlier than 8 weeks and no later      than 15 weeks), patients will resume treatment with HER2-specific CAR T cells for up to 2      infusions if they meet laboratory parameters.      The first patient in the surgical study will complete a 6-week safety evaluation period prior      to enrollment of the subsequent patient. The length of time on study for patients enrolled on      the Surgical study is anticipated to be 10 months on treatment. Patients will then be      followed for 15 years after treatment.      Dosing      All patients on Phase I and Surgical study will receive HER2 CAR T cells at a      patient-specific dose level 1 (8x10^7 CAR-positive T cells/m^2) for infusion. The cell dose      will be based on the patient weight and height obtained by the treating institution at the      time of procurement. For patients whose BMI is greater than 95th percentile for given age and      sex, the Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated using the ideal body weight.      In the event that dose level 1 is found to have excessive toxicity, three additional doses of      CAR T cells at dose level -1 (5x10^7 CAR-positive T cells/m^2) will be made to be used in the      event that dose de-escalation occurs before a patient is enrolled for treatment.

All patients in Surgical cohort who received at least 1 dose of HER2 CAR T cells are included in the assessment., Percentage of Subjects whose Treatment Delivery Meets Feasibility CriteriaApproximately 3 months after enrollment for treatmentAssessment of feasibility is in the context of conducting an investigator-initiated (not industry sponsored) multi-institutional trial of CAR T cells. This would specifically include the feasibility of manufacturing the cells at one center and shipping them to other sites for administration and the infusion process. If more than 25% of patients cannot be treated as intended due to manufacturing, shipping or administration related causes (jointly considered as feasibility criteria), this would be considered unacceptable. If the treatment is not delivered as intended due to one or more manufacturing, shipping, or administration related causes, this instance will be counted as feasibility failure for that subject.","

","        Criteria for Screening          1. Tumor             Patient must have a diagnosis of ependymoma that is recurrent or progressive. All             tumors must have histologic verification either at the time of diagnosis or             recurrence.          2. Prior Therapy             Patient must have received standard of care therapy including maximal safe surgical             resection followed by local adjuvant radiation therapy prior to enrollment.          3. Adequate Pre-trial Tumor Tissue             Patient must have adequate pre-trial tumor material available to determine HER2             status. Tumor tissue from the most recent resection or biopsy of recurrent disease in             preferred. If unavailable, tumor tissue from prior recurrences or from the time of             initial diagnosis is acceptable.             a. One exception will be patients who have previously received HER2-directed therapy             (including but not limited to trastuzumab); these patients will need evaluation of             tumor HER2 status after stopping treatment due to the possibility of HER2             downregulation or loss.             Tumor biopsy will not be performed for the purpose of HER2 screening. Patients will             not be eligible for screening on PBTC-059 if tumor tissue is not available or             inadequate for HER2 testing. Tumor screening by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be             done centrally using the testing method validated at Texas Children's Hospital. Sample             for screening must be shipped within 7 days of enrollment for screening.          4. Known HIV Positivity             Patients that are known to be HIV-positive are ineligible due to the unknown safety             and efficacy of infusing these patients with CAR T cells genetically modified using             retroviral vectors.

Procurement Exclusion Criteria        1. Known HIV Positivity        Patients who are known to be HIV-positive are ineligible due to the unknown safety and        efficacy of infusing these patients with CAR T cells genetically modified using retroviral        vectors. Additionally, the immunosuppression used for treatment in this study will pose an        unacceptable risk.        Criteria for Treatment        All Phase I (Stratum 1) and Surgical (Stratum 2) subjects must meet following inclusion and        exclusion eligibility criteria at the time of enrollment for treatment. No exceptions will        be given. Imaging studies must be done within 14 days prior to enrollment. All other        clinical and laboratory evaluations to establish eligibility for treatment must be done 7        days prior to enrollment.        Treatment Inclusion Criteria          1. Diagnosis             Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of HER2 positive ependymoma that is             recurrent or progressive. Histologic verification may be from time of diagnosis or             time of recurrence. In cases where there is question of recurrence, histologic             verification, or verification of progression on follow up imaging is required prior to             enrolling for protocol treatment.          2. Disease Status             Phase I (Stratum 1) - Patients must have evaluable disease to be eligible.

Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy        test within 7 days of start of enrollment for treatment. If the urine test is positive or        cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.        Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown        but potential risk of adverse events to the fetus or the nursing infant with the use of T        cells genetically modified to express HER2 CAR. Pre-clinical studies in mice demonstrate        the target antigen HER2 is necessary for normal fetal development of cardiac trabeculae,        cranial sensory ganglia, and motor neuron development.75 Additionally, the lymphodepleting        chemotherapy drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are both Pregnancy Class D drugs.        4.

Patients with any of the following cardiac diseases          1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV          2. Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia including, but not limited to, Torsade de             pointes or requiring a pacemaker          3. Left ventricular ejection fraction below 50% as determined by echocardiography (ECHO)        Known HIV positivity        a. HIV-positive patients are ineligible due to the unknown safety and efficacy of infusing        these patients with CAR T cells genetically modified using retroviral vectors.        Additionally, the immunosuppression used for treatment in this study will pose an        unacceptable risk.        5. Concomitant Medications        Patients who are receiving any other anti-cancer or investigational drug therapy are        ineligible.

",      GLM dose Optimisation to Adequate Levels to Achieve Response in Colitis (GOAL-ARC). A      nationwide multi-centred randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the use of GLM dose      adjustment in ulcerative colitis (UC). The primary objective is to ascertain if dose      adjustment of GLM based on GLM drug levels and FCP levels results in higher response and      remission rates than standard SmPC dosing.    ,"      UC is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in which the lining of the large intestine      become inflamed. There is no official database which gives accurate figures but it is thought      that at least 20,000 people are living with IBD in Ireland. Males and females are affected      equally and patients can be diagnosed at any age, including babies and children. The peak age      of incidence is between the ages of 15 and 35, with a second (smaller) peak from the 50s to      70s.      GLM is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody produced by a murine hybridoma cell line with      recombinant DNA technology. It is part of the immunosuppressants pharmacotherapeutic group of      TNF-α inhibitors. It is licensed for use in several chronic inflammatory conditions including      UC, Psoriatic arthritis, axial spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis.      The design of GOAL-ARC aims to address the impact of dose escalation of GLM immediately      following induction and during the subsequent maintenance phase in response to suboptimal      drugs levels or persisting inflammatory burden as represented by raised faecal calprotectin      (FCP). FCP has been shown to correlate closely to endoscopic disease activity6.    ",,"

There is an unmet      medical need to develop new therapy modalities. In preclinical studies, GL-ONC1, has shown      the ability to preferentially locate, colonize and destroy tumor cells in more than 30      different human tumors, including ovarian cancer. GL-ONC1 has been investigated in early      stage clinical trials in the United States and Europe via systemic delivery as monotherapy      and in combination with other therapies, and via regional delivery as monotherapy. GL-ONC1      treatment was well tolerated across different malignancies, routes of administration, and      monotherapy as well as combination therapy protocols. The ability of GL-ONC1 to infect tumor      tissue and kill tumor cells was demonstrated. In addition, virus-induced immune activation      and favorable anti-tumor immune response have been observed. Evidences of anti-tumor efficacy      and clinical benefits have also been documented.    ",,"

","      Background:      - Gene therapy involves changing the genes inside the body s cells to stop disease. It is      very closely regulated. People who have had this therapy may have problems months or even      years later. Researchers do not know the long-term side effects, so they want to study people      who have had the therapy. They want the study to continue over the next 15 years.      Objective:      - To study over time the negative side effects from genetically engineered cellular therapy.      This will be studied in people who have been in Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB) gene therapy      trials.      Eligibility:      - People who are currently or were previously in a research study with gene therapy in the      National Cancer Institute POB.      Design:        -  Participants blood will be tested right before they get the genetically changed cells.           They will get the cells as part of another study.        -  For the next year, they will come back to the clinic or see their doctor at home at           least every 3 months. They will answer questions about their health and blood will be           drawn.        -  For the next 5 years, they will go to the clinic or see their own doctor once a year.           They will have physical exam and blood will be drawn.        -  For 10 years after that, they will be asked every year for health information.        -  Participants will keep their contact information up to date with researchers. They may           be phoned for more health information.        -  If the participant was under 18 years old when given the gene therapy and turns 18           during this follow-up, they will be asked to sign a new consent form when they turn 18.    ","      Background:        -  Study subjects exposed to gene therapy interventions may be at risk for delayed or           longterm adverse consequences. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued           Long Term Follow-up After Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products: Guidance for           Industry and Testing of Retroviral Vector-Based Human Gene Therapy Products for           Replication Competent Retrovirus During Product Manufacture and Patient Follow-up:           Guidance for Industry, which outlines a framework to assess the risk of gene           therapy-related delayed adverse events and the essential elements appropriate for the           conduct of long-term follow up observations.        -  Accordingly, some vector designs (i.e. use of an adenovirus), based on duration of           persistence accompanied by cumulative preclinical and clinical evidence, may require           shorter periods of observation than other vector designs (i.e. use of a lentivirus).      Objective:      -To conduct long term safety evaluations for adverse events associated with genetically      engineered cellular therapy in subjects who have participated in Pediatric Oncology Branch      (POB) clinical trials.      Eligibility:      -Subjects who are planned to receive or have received at least one dose of a genetically      engineered cellular therapy on a POB gene therapy clinical trial are eligible to participate.      Design:        -  Subjects will be evaluated for long term safety and occurrence of adverse events           according to the requirements established by the FDA guidance and the NIH Guidelines for           Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (NIH Guidelines), to           include:        -  Long term follow-up after genetically engineered cellular therapy may include:             -  Post-cell infusion evaluations for T-Cell persistence (if applicable)             -  Monitoring for replication-competent retrovirus (RCR) or replication-competent                lentivirus (RCL)             -  Physical examination             -  Questionnaire to detect delayed adverse events             -  Medical record review related to long term adverse events        -  To ensure adequate follow up for participants in POB receiving genetically engineered           cellular therapy, a maximum accrual of 500 participants will be allowed on this study.

","      Persistent HBs antigenemia >1000 IU/ml has a possibility of viral reactivation and hepatoma      in 8%; the effect of HBV vaccine on HBsAg was investigated, recurrence of viremia, insulin      resistance, and fibrosis regression.      From August 2011 to October 2016, 220 participants with chronic hepatitis B were evaluated at      the hepatology clinic-Internal medicine department-Zagazig university-Egypt. They were      enrolled after approval of the ethical committee of Zagazig university hospital. Written      informed consent was obtained for the interview, clinical evaluation, and blood sampling.      participants were divided into two groups:        -  Inactive carriers (n=100) who were presented with persistent HBsAg, undetected HBV DNA,           normal liver enzymes, positive HBeAb and had never been exposed to antiviral therapy.        -  Patients exposed to NAs (n=120): tenofovir 300mg (n=65) or Entecavir 1mg (n=55): A-           HBeAg-positive patients (n=60) who received NAs until 1 year after HBe seroconversion           and disappearance of HBV DNA with persistent HBsAg B- HBeAg-negative patients (n=60) who           received NAs till 3 years after the disappearance of HBV DNA; all showed persistent           HBsAg.        -  Exclusion criteria Clinically decompensated liver cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma;           other causes of liver disease or mixed causes (excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune           liver disease, immunosuppressive drugs, or who had been infected with hepatitis C virus.      B- Vaccination schedule        -  All the participants had received 30 µg of recombinant HBV vaccine which contains           Purified HBsAg produced by recombinant DNA technology (Euvax-B, LG Life Sciences, Korea)           intramuscularly in the deltoid region at three different time intervals (0, 1, 6           months). The first dose of the vaccine was initiated 1 year after HBe seroconversion and           disappearance of HBV DNA in HBe +ve or 3 years after the disappearance of HBV DNA in HBe           -ve patients or immediately after diagnosis of inactive carriers. NAs were stopped three           months after the 3rd dose of HBV vaccine        -  Three months after the last dose of vaccine, the participants were evaluated for IP-10           level, the production of protective HBsAb, recurrence of viremia by regular HBV DNA,           HBsAg quantification.      Patients who failed to produce HBsAb i.e. HBsAb titer < 10 IU/ml, were given a fourth booster      dose of vaccination immediately after confirmation of vaccine non-response.      C- Control Group It included 100 participants who had CHB, with undetectable HBV DNA with      persistence of HBsAg and they did not receive HBV vaccine. They were divided into treatment      naïve (n=50) and treatment experienced (n=50) who were given tenofovir (n=30) or entecavir      (n=20) which were stopped 3 years after HBV DNA disappearance and HBeAg seroconversion and      followed for 3 years by evaluation of HBsAg level and HBV DNA every 6 months to detect the      natural rate of HBV reactivation.      D- Laboratory analysis It included complete Blood Count, liver function tests, prothrombin      time, prothrombin concentration (%), kidney function tests.        -  HCV antibody, HBeAg, HBeAb, HBcAb.        -  Real-time Quantitative PCR for HBV DNA was done at the baseline and then every 6 months           after the last dose of HBV vaccine for 3 years (COBAS AMPLICOR HBV MONITOR, with a           detection limit of 15 IU/ml; Roche Diagnostic Systems).        -  Insulin resistance was done before initiation of vaccination and 3 months after the last           dose of vaccination. It was calculated by HOMA-IR, a value greater than 2 indicates           insulin resistance [20].        -  HBV genotyping was performed using INNO-LiPA HBV Genotyping assay; Innogenetics NV,           Ghent, Belgium.        -  Determination of HBsAg titer (Elecsys HBsAg II assay, Roche Diagnostics, USA) [21]. It           was done before vaccination and 3 months after the last dose of vaccine then every 6           months for 3 years.        -  Anti-HBs antibodies were performed 3 months following the third dose of the vaccine or 3           months after the 4th booster dose. Seroconversion was considered if anti-HBs levels were           above 10 IU/ml and non-response if anti-HBs levels were below 10 IU/ml [22].        -  Serum IP-10 levels were determined in serum before vaccination and 3 months after the           last dose of vaccine, by a solid-phase sandwich ELISA (Quantikine, R&D Systems, USA)           (reference value: 7.8-500 pg/ml).      E- Abdominal ultrasonography participants were examined after 6 hours fast. Criteria of      cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and the presence of fatty liver disease were documented.      F- Liver stiffness assessment (LSM) Fibroscan was performed to measure liver stiffness before      antiviral therapy and 3 months after the last dose of HBV vaccine, with the number of shots      is 10, interquartile range≤ 25%.

","      The research project involves gene transfer into keratinocytes, which are the majority of the      cells in the outer layer of skin. In this gene transfer trial we plan to biopsy some skin      tissue, grow the cells in a skin cell culture (sterile dishes with special fluid that allows      cells to grow and multiply) and then infect the cells with a virus that we have genetically      engineered to insert the correct type VII collagen gene.

The virus used is called a ""retrovirus."" The virus is made so that it only      delivers the type VII collagen gene and it should not spread to other parts of the body.

Infusion of autologous patient blood stem cells that      have been corrected in the laboratory by introduction of the normal gene may improve blood      counts in patients with FA.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To determine the safety of lentiviral gene transfer for patients with Fanconi anemia      complementation group A.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of filgrastim (G-CSF) and plerixafor      mobilization in FA patients.      II. To determine the feasibility and efficacy of lineage depletion of bone marrow or      mobilized apheresis product.      III. To determine the transduction efficiency for human FA patient hematopoietic progenitor      cells transduced with a clinical grade lentiviral vector encoding the gene for Fanconi anemia      complementation group A.      IV. To determine if gene transfer using the clinical grade vector will result in phenotypic      correction of gene modified cells by in vitro assays.      V. To determine if infusion of FANCA gene-modified cells will result in engraftment and      persistence of gene-modified cells and improvement in blood counts in FA patients.      OUTLINE:      STEM CELL MOBILIZATION FOR CELL COLLECTION: Patients receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC)      twice daily (BID) for up to 6 days (on days 1-6 of mobilization). Patients receive plerixafor      SC once daily (QD) on days 4-6 of mobilization. Peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) count will      be checked daily starting on day 4 of mobilization. Patients who have a PBSC count of >= 5      CD34+ cells/mcL will undergo up to 2 apheresis collections on consecutive days.      BONE MARROW HARVEST FOR CELL COLLECTION: Patients with inadequate PBSC counts undergo bone      marrow harvest for collection of stem/progenitor cells.

A First-in-Man,      Phase I clinical study focusing on the safety and tolerability of GL-ONC1 intravenously      administered to patients with a variety of advanced solid tumor entities has shown that      GL-ONC1 is well-tolerated at therapeutic dose levels, with documented evidence of antitumor      activity. Preclinical studies have further shown synergistic effects with the use of      chemotherapy (Cisplatin) and viral therapy with GL-ONC, as well as favorable results when      cancer cells are irradiated and then treated with GL-ONC1 in animal models. This Phase I      study seeks to evaluate the safety, tolerability and early signs of efficacy of GL-ONC1      administered intravenously in combination with standard of care (SOC) radiation therapy (RT)      and cisplatin (CDDP)in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer.

","      Diabetic macular edema refers to swelling (fluid accumulation) in the center of the retina.      The retina is like the film of a camera and is located in the back of the eye. This condition      can develop in diabetics where swelling results from leaking of fluid from the blood vessels      of the eye, into the center of the retina, the macula. If left untreated, this can affect      central.      The current standard treatment for diabetic macular edema includes medications injected      directly into the eye (intravitreal injections) and laser eye treatment. The drugs that are      injected directly into the eye are known as anti-VEGF agents which help to reduce the      leaking. This includes bevacizumab (Avastin®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®).      However, some patients do not respond well to these anti-VEGF treatments and will be given      the option of switching to an another newer anti-VEGF medication, called aflibercept (Eylea®)      that is approved to treat DME. A recent large study has demonstrated that aflibercept was as      efficacious as other anti-VEGF therapies listed above and was even superior in patients with      worse vision (Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network, Wells JA, Glassman AR, et al.      Aflibercept, Bevacizumab, or Ranibizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema. N Engl J Med.      2015:150218140025008-150218140025008).      The purpose of this study is to determine what factors affect the treatment response to      aflibercept (amount of swelling reduction) for patients with diabetic macular edema, who were      previously unresponsive to ranibizumab injections.

","      Investigation into the use of teriparatide in the treatment of stress fractures.      Primary outcome is healing on MRI, secondary outcomes are pain, time spent in rehabilitation      and future stress fractures. This study will help the investigators understand how to treat      stress fractures in the future.    ","      Teriparatide is a drug that is designed to have a similar effect on the body as parathyroid      hormone. Parathyroid hormone is made naturally in the body and is released in response to low      calcium levels. It helps to maintain bone health and repair bone damage. Parathyroid hormone      and medicines like teriparatide can strengthen bones and are often given to people with      osteoporosis (a condition that weakens bones, making them more likely to break) to reduce the      risk of fractures. Recent studies have also shown benefits in people with stress fracture      injuries, a form of bone damage sometimes caused by repetitive exercise. The investigators      want to know if teriparatide is also beneficial to healthy, younger people who have a stress      fracture injury.    ",,"

","      The Investigators propose to test the hypothesis that GCSF therapy enhances the clinical      outcome of Kasai operated Biliary Atresia (BA) patients. In this study, Investigators will      conduct a dose determination for GCSF use in post Kasai subjects to support a future phase 2      efficacy study. The first 3 post Kasai BA subjects with liver biopsy-confirmed BA will be      given 5 ug/kg/d of GCSF in 3 daily subcutaneous doses starting on post Kasai day 3. A second      group of 3 subjects will be assigned to the 10 ug/Kg/d dose after the 5ug/kg/d dose has been      proven to be safe. The levels of circulating hematopoietic stem cells and a 1-month safety      profile will be analyzed.    ","      In BA, neonatal fibrous obliteration of the biliary tract obstructs biliary drainage and      promotes biliary fibrosis. BA is the leading cause of pediatric chronic end-stage liver      disease and pediatric liver transplantation. Relief of cholestasis by the Kasai      portoenterostomy is only partly successful with continued progression of fibrosis to hepatic      insufficiency and, for long term survival, with eventual need for liver transplantation in      the majority of the patients. In animal models of liver injury, GCSF enhances hematopoietic      stem cell HSC mobilization and engraftment in the liver with associated improved liver repair      response and attenuated hepatic necrosis and fibrosis. Randomized controlled trials of GCSF      intervention for chronic liver failure in adult patients with acute hepatic decompensation      showed improved short-term survival and hepatic indices such the model for end-stage liver      disease (MELD) scores.      The Investigators propose that post Kasai GCSF therapy attenuates biliary fibrosis and      progression to cirrhosis. The objectives are meant to demonstrate that Kasai-GCSF sequential      therapy improves biliary drainage, and delays the progression of hepatic insufficiency.      Toward this goal, Investigators will first evaluate in post Kasai subjects the maximum      tolerated dose of GCSF in mobilizing circulating CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells, with the      limiting dose based on GCSF-related severe adverse effects. A one-month safety of GCSF will      be tested with the 2 standard doses of 5 ug/kg/d and 10 ug/kg/d.    ",,"

","      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of modified umbilical cord blood      immune cells (natural killer [NK] cells) combined with the antibody AFM13 (AFM13-NK) and      AFM13 alone in treating patients with CD30 positive Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma      that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy      with monoclonal antibodies, such as AFM13, may help the body's immune system attack the      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Giving AFM13      loaded with NK cells followed by AFM13 alone may kill more cancer cells and decrease cancer      growth in patients with CD30 positive AFM13-NK Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To establish the safety and recommended phase II dose of umbilical cord blood (CB)-derived      natural killer (NK) cells preloaded with the bispecific antibody AFM13 (AFM13-NK), followed      by intravenous anti-CD30/CD16A monoclonal antibody AFM13 (AFM13) in patients with      refractory/relapsed CD30-positive lymphoid malignancies.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To assess the overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate and partial      response (PR) rate.      II. To evaluate the duration of response. III. To evaluate the event-free survival (EFS)      rate. IV. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) time. V. To quantify the persistence of      infused donor CB AFM13-NK cells in the recipient.      VI. To conduct comprehensive immune reconstitution studies.      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of AFM13-NK.      Patients receive standard of care fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and standard of      care cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes on days -4 to -2, AFM13-NK IV over 4 hours on day      0, and then AFM13 IV over 4 hours on days 7, 14, and 21.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days, 8 weeks, 100 and      180 days and then every 3-6 months for 2 years.    ",,"

","      ONCR-177-101 is a phase 1, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation and expansion study of      ONCR-177, an oncolytic Herpes Simplex Virus for intratumoral injection, alone and in      combination with PD-1 blockade in adult subjects with advanced and/or refractory cutaneous,      subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors or with Liver Metastases of Solid Tumors. The      purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase      2 dose (RP2D), as well as to evaluate preliminary efficacy.    ","      ONCR-177 is an intratumorally administered oncolytic immunotherapy comprised of a genetically      engineered HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus type 1) that selectively replicates in tumor tissue.      Oncorus Inc. is developing ONCR-177 both as monotherapy and in combination with PD-1 blockade      for the treatment of advanced solid tumor malignancies. This first-in-human (FIH) Phase 1      dose escalation and expansion study will determine the intratumoral dose of ONCR-177 as a      monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab, in subjects with advanced and/or      refractory cutaneous, subcutaneous or metastatic nodal solid tumors or with Liver Metastases      of Solid Tumors. This protocol will enroll subjects who have at least one lesion that is      visible, palpable or detectable and can be injected, and subjects who have liver metastases      of solid tumors. Subjects with any cancer types who are eligible for the trial and have such      lesions can be considered for enrollment. Additionally, preliminary evidence for clinical and      immunologic activity will be sought to guide ongoing studies and development of ONCR-177 in      subjects with cancers that are unmet medical needs. Confirmation of safety of ONCR-177      administration in combination with pembrolizumab will also be evaluated in this study, to      enable development as part of combination immunotherapy.    ",,"

","      Please note that enrollment on this study terminated early due to the end of grant funding.      Newly diagnosed WHO grade IV malignant glioma subjects who are eligible were enrolled      following surgery to remove their brain tumor. They then underwent a leukapheresis to harvest      cells for the generation of the study drug, Epidermal Growth Factor variant III Chimeric      Antigen Receptor (EGFRvIII CAR) T cells prior to beginning standard of care (SOC) radiation      therapy (RT) with temozolomide (TMZ). Once SOC RT with TMZ was completed, subjects returned      for the post-RT brain imaging assessment, and, if stable, started post-RT TMZ cycles.      Patients received up to 3 cycles of dose-intensified TMZ prior to receiving the EGFRvIII CAR      T cells, which was infused in dose escalation cohorts. Following a one-month delay between      cycles, the subject resumed post-RT cycles of TMZ and were monitored with blood work and      brain imaging as per SOC.      An expanded cohort of 12 subjects was originally planned for once the maximally tolerated      dose (MTD) was reached in the dose escalation cohorts, in order to obtain a more precise      estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity and to track the EGFRvIII CAR T cells      using 111 Indium (111In) labeling. Computed Tomography (CT) was planned on days 1, 2, and 3      post-infusion to determine intracerebral (IC) localization.    ","      Please note that enrollment on this study terminated early due to the end of grant funding.      Following consent, subjects were enrolled onto dose-escalation cohorts. Patients will      underwent leukapheresis to harvest Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) for the      generation of EGFRvIII CAR T cells prior to beginning RT and concurrent TMZ. T cells were      isolated from the patient's PBMCs and transduced to express the CAR. Briefly, PBMCs were      stimulated with Muromonab-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) (OKT3), an anti-CD3 monoclonal      antibody (mAb), and transduced on RetroNectin® coated plates. Transduced cells were expanded      in interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 14 days.      Patients then completed standard of care RT and concurrent TMZ. Patients who remained      eligible after standard of care radiation and TMZ received up to 3 cycles of TMZ at 50-100      mg/m^2/day for 21 days of 28 day cycles, which is the standard dose-intensified (DI) TMZ      regimen. If the CAR-specific T cells did not meet release criteria, the patient was withdrawn      before CAR treatment and replaced.      At least 48 hours after the last dose of DI TMZ, the total dose of EGFRvIII CAR T cells were      delivered intravenously. If sufficient CAR-specific T cells could not be generated to meet      the targeted assigned dose within the dose-escalation portion of the study, the patient was      have been treated at a lower pre-defined dose level using available CAR-specific T cells and      replaced in the assigned higher dose. The administered dose would have been the highest      defined dose level for which there are sufficient CAR-specific T cells available. Within the      expanded cohort, if sufficient CAR-specific T cells could not be generated to meet the MTD      dose, all available T cells would be administered.      Following the infusion of EGFRvIII CARs, blood samples for immune monitoring were drawn 1, 5,      and 10 days after the infusion, then 1, 3, and 6 months, then yearly until progression (or      death or lost to contact). The return visits for immune monitoring at 3 months, 6 months, and      yearly coincided with SOC clinic visits. Blood was also taken for Replication Competent      Retrovirus (RCR) Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) per the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)      at 3, 6, and 12 months during SOC clinic visits. Lastly, blood for evaluation of cytokine      release syndrome (CRS) was drawn prior to cell infusion, 1 and 4 hours after infusion, and on      days 1, 2, 5, 10, and at one month. Measurements for CRS included IL-2, IL-6, Tumor Necrosis      Factor alpha (TNFα), interferon (IFN) gamma, Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor      (GM-CSF), and C-reactive protein (CRP).      Patients returned to clinic one month following the EGFRvIII CAR T cell infusion to be      evaluated for cycles of SOC 5-day TMZ at 150-200 mg/m^2/day for the first 5-day cycle,      followed by 200 mg/m^2/day for 5-days every 28 days per the treating oncologist. This      resulted in a >30 day delay between the last cycle of DI TMZ and the first cycle of 5-day      TMZ.      Tumor progression was documented histologically, unless there were clinical      contraindications, to exclude inflammatory responses presenting as radiographic or clinical      changes, which could indicate a potentially toxic or therapeutic responses and not tumor      progression. If tissue was obtained through Duke Brain Tumor Center Biorepository, it was      used to confirm tumor progression histologically, and to assess immunologic cell infiltration      and EGFRvIII antigen escape at the tumor site. Patients would be eligible for additional      adjuvant therapy at the time of tumor progression.      A classical ""3+3"" study design was planned to estimate the MTD for CAR-specific T cells      treatment among patients with newly-diagnosed GBM. Four dose levels were to be considered:      #1: 4.5 x 10^6/kg, #2: 1.5 x 10^7/kg, #3: 4.5 x 10^7/kg, and #4: 1.5 x 10^8/kg. Starting with      the lowest dose level, cohorts of 3-6 subjects would be accrued at each dose level. If a      patient was lost to follow-up during the first 4 weeks after CAR treatment without      experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), then the patient was not considered evaluable      for the determination of DLT and would be replaced. The MTD was considered to be the highest      dose level at which ≤1 of 6 patients experienced DLT during the 4-week observation period      after CAR treatment. Only 3-patient cohort was enrolled at the the first dose level due to      grant funding ending.      An expanded cohort of 12 patients was planned at the MTD of EGFRvIII CAR T cells, in order to      obtain a more precise estimate of the probability of unacceptable toxicity. This cohort would      have the cells radiolabeled with 111In to track their distribution. Briefly, CARs would have      been counted and re-suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). 4-6x10^8 cells would be      labeled with a total of 500 microCi of 111In. The cells would be washed and mixed with cold      CARs to achieve the desired cell dose. The labeled CARs would be infused into the patient      through an intravenous catheter within the Ambulatory Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT) Unit.      Distribution of 111In-labeled EGFRvIII CARs would be evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 days      post-infusion using scintigraphy. There was no enrollment on the expanded cohort due to grant      funding ending.    ","

Biological
EGFRvIII CAR T cells
The name of the drug is CAR gene-modified T cells or abbreviated as EGFRvIII CARs. The class of action is a biological and the mechanism of action is cytotoxicity. The drug substance is autologous T cells transduced with a retroviral vector encoding for a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against the tumor specific antigen, EGFRvIII. EGFRvIII CARs are genetically engineered T cells that have been taken from patients with GBM ex vivo to express a CAR recognizing the GBM tumor-specific antigen EGFRvIII, which is expressed on a subset of GBMs but not in normal human tissues with the aim of mediating regression of their tumors. Patients' CARs will be radiolabeled with 111In for correlative studies in the expanded cohort.

","      The success of anti-CTLA4 therapy has inaugurated a paradigm shift in oncology where drugs      target the immune system rather than cancer cells in order to stimulate the anti-tumor immune      response. In situ immunization is a strategy where immunomodulatory products such as      pathogens are injected into one tumor site in order to trigger a systemic anti-tumor immune      response. Of importance, pre-clinical rationale has demonstrated that combination of      anti-CTLA4 therapy together with intra-tumoral (IT) oncolytic virus can overcome primary      resistance to systemic anti-CTLA4 therapy. Pexastimogene Devacirepvec (Pexa-Vec) is one of      the new vaccinia oncolytic viruses genetically modified to express GM-CSF. This new and      innovative oncolytic virotherapy should therefore synergize with anti-CTLA4 therapy via      virus-induced tumor cell death & tumor-antigen release, GM-CSF-induced      recruitment/maturation/activation of antigen presenting cells, and anti-CTLA4-induced Treg      blockade/depletion. Intra-tumoral delivery of immunostimulating agents should, therefore,      provide lower toxicity of mAb targeting immune checkpoints. Of note, IT injections of      GM-CSF-encoding oncolytic viruses have already been shown to induce immune-mediated tumor      responses on local (injected) and distant (not injected) tumor sites. In solid injectable      refractory/relapsing metastatic tumors, we make the hypothesis that the addition of Pexa-Vec      to IT ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 Ab) will overcome primary/secondary resistance to standard      therapy and/or immunotherapy with a better in situ tumor antigen specific T-cell priming. Our      proposal is to conduct a 2-part Phase I clinical trial in order to define the feasibility,      the safety and the anti-tumor effects of intra-tumoral injections of ipilimumab in      combination with the oncolytic virus Pexa-Vec. Dose escalation step will define the MTD and      RP2D of that in situ immunization strategy. Expansion part will assess the anti-tumor effect      of the combination.    ","      The study is a proof of concept, open label, multicentric, 2-parts, Phase I dose escalation      trial. In dose selection part (any histological types except HCC), patients will be treated      with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection ) alone at Week      1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec + ipilimumab (up to 4 dose levels) at Weeks 3, 5 and      9. The dose escalation part will follow a classical 3+3 design. 3 to 6 patients will be      enrolled at each DL (Dose Level) depending of the number of Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)      observed. At the end of each DL cohort, a teleconference (Dose escalation meeting) will be      organized with the sponsor, in order to select the dose for the next cohort. In Expansion      cohorts ( up to 3 cohorts) patients will be treated with an IT boost injection with Pexa-Vec      alone (fixed dose of 1x109 pfu / injection) at Week 1 followed by IT injections of Pexa-Vec +      ipilimumab (RP2D) at Weeks 3, 5 and 9. In both parts, the treatment with both IMPs should be      continued as per protocol until Withdrawal of consent, Disease progression as per irRC      (immune related response criteria), General or specific changes in the patient's condition      that render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the      investigator, Pregnancy or Unacceptable adverse events(s) including DLTs.

","      This is a first-in-human clinical trial to test whether a protein administered into the brain      continuously by gene therapy, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), will slow or prevent      cell loss in the brains of people affected by Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive      Impairment. The protein may also activate cells in the brain that have not yet deteriorated.      Gene therapy refers to the use of a harmless virus to have brain cells make the potentially      protective protein, BDNF.    ","      This is an open label Phase I clinical trial of AAV2-BDNF gene therapy for early Alzheimer's      Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in 12 participants.      BDNF is a nervous system growth factor that regulates neuronal function in key memory      circuits of the brain (the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). BDNF reduces cell loss,      stimulates cell function, and builds new connections (synapses) between brain cells in animal      models.      This clinical trial will use techniques of gene therapy because the candidate therapeutic      protein, BDNF, does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Two previous clinical programs      of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) gene therapy for AD and Neurturin gene therapy for Parkinson's      disease in over 120 patients provided evidence that degenerating neurons respond to growth      factors with classic ""trophic"" responses in the human brain.      Participants will undergo one gene transfer procedure. Thus, dosing is performed only once,      and repeat dosing or daily medications are not expected to be required.      12 participants will be enrolled in this Phase I trial, 6 with early AD and 6 with MCI.

","      This study is the study of the combination of PEGPH20 and Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for      patients with previously treated Hyaluronan High (HA-high) metastatic pancreatic ductal      adenocarcinoma. This study is an interventional, unblinded, open label study. Approximately      35 subjects will be enrolled. The trial will require approximately a total of 18 months,      including 12 months for enrollment, with an additional 6 months for patient follow-up, data      collection and study closure.      Each subject will participate in the trial from the time the subject signs the Informed      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of up to 21 days,      eligible subjects will receive PEGPH20 beginning with Cycle 1 Day 1, on Days 1, 8 15 of every      3 week-cycles and pembrolizumab beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 (2-4 hrs after PEGPH20), every      3-week-cycles.      Treatment with PEGPH20 and pembrolizumab will continue until progressive disease (PD),      unacceptable adverse events (AEs), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration      of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdraws consent,      pregnancy of the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements,      subject receives 35 treatments (approximately 24 months) of pembrolizumab, or administrative      reasons requiring cessation of treatment. Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than PD      will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until PD, initiating a non-study cancer      treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed      by telephone for overall survival (OS) until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the      study.      After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for 30 days for AE monitoring.      Serious adverse events (SAE) and events of clinical interest (ECI) will be collected for 90      days after the end of treatment or for 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject      initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier.    ","      Combination strategies geared towards blocking the PD1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway, such as with      pembrolizumab, concurrent with stroma depletion (PEGPH20) may induce synergistic anti-cancer      activity and immune responses in pancreatic cancer. Effective harnessing of the immune system      and rational combinations with stroma-targeting biological agents (PEGPH20) is a novel field      that needs to be explored in pancreatic cancer. This phase II trial will determine the      efficacy of pembrolizumab plus PEGPH20 in metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have      HA-high tumor expression. Stroma and immune-related biomarkers will be tested prospectively      in blood and tumor biopsies at baseline, after 6 weeks of therapy, and at time of cancer      progression. A phase I study with pembrolizumab and PEGPH20 is ongoing in lung and gastric      cancer patients (NCT02563548), and demonstrated safety and tolerability of this combination      at the doses administered in this study (Halozyme data).      Immunotherapies have the potential to induce durable therapeutic responses although this      typically occurs in a small fraction of patients. Biomarker-guided patient selection can, in      principle, identify those patients most likely to benefit. The investigators hypothesize that      stroma remodeling with PEGPH20 will potentiate effector CD8 T cell lymphocyte infiltration      and sensitize pancreatic cancer to immune therapy, and that immunologic, and/or genomic      biomarkers will identify patient subsets most likely to benefit. As examples, MSI-high status      and high tumor mutational burden (hypermutation) have been linked to sensitivity to immune      checkpoint inhibitors (Le et al. 2015, Le et al. 2016).      Assays may include but are not limited to: Immunohistochemical analysis, profiling of the      immune transcriptome, circulating cytokine analyses, flow cytometric analyses of peripheral      and intratumoral immune response.      This is an open label non-randomized Phase II trial for patients with previously treated      metastatic ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HA-high expression, to assess the      progression-free survival rate (PFS) of patients treated with this combination therapy.      Secondary endpoints will assess safety and tolerability, overall response rate (ORR), disease      control rate (DCR= CR+PR+SD), duration of response and stable disease (DOR), and overall      survival (OS).      There will be an estimated 35 patients enrolled into the study, using 5 centers in the U.S.      Overall response rates as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will      be determined using RECIST 1.1. Time-to-event endpoints, including PFS and OS will be      assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Toxicity (adverse events) will be recorded using the      NCI CTCAE, version 5.0 (published Nov 2017, Appendix B).      All patients will start treatment with PEGPH20 3 microgram/kg IV weekly x 3, and      pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, in 3-week cycles.      Patients may remain on treatment with PEGPH20 in combination with pembrolizumab as long as      they are receiving clinical benefit, until disease progression per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or      until untolerable toxicity develops, whichever comes first. If no disease progression,      patients will be allowed to remain on study treatment for up to 24 months. If no disease      progression, but with unacceptable toxicity from PEGPH20, patients will be allowed to      continue on pembrolizumab alone for up to 24 months if deemed appropriate by the      investigator. If pembrolizumab needs to be discontinued for toxicity, patients may continue      treatment with PEGPH20 alone.      The estimated duration for accrual is anticipated to be 12 months. Patients will be followed      up for a minimum of 6 months. The overall study duration is estimated at approximately 18      months.    ",,"

","      GSK1070806 is a humanised monoclonal antibody that blocks a protein present in the body      called Interleukin-18. The main purpose of this study is to test GSK1070806 in healthy and      obese male subjects with normal immune systems to find out how safe this drug is and how long      the body takes to get rid of it. The study consists of 2 parts. Part 1 will consist of 6      groups of healthy male subjects and Part 2 will consist of 3 groups of obese male subjects. A      total of 89 subjects is planned for this study. Subjects in each group will receive one dose      of the study drug or placebo. Dosing in Part 2 will not start until dosing of the first 4      groups is completed in Part 1 and the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic data from these      4 groups in Part 1 has been reviewed. Both parts will be conducted single-blind and with a      placebo control. Within each group, allocation of subjects to placebo or active treatment      (GSK1070806) will be randomised.    ",,,"

Drug
GSK1070806
The study drug, GSK1070806, is a humanised monoclonal antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are made by white blood cells during an immune reaction. They circulate in the blood and attach to foreign proteins called antigens in order to destroy or neutralise them.
Humanised monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein that is genetically engineered to resemble a human protein (humanised). GSK1070806 is designed to block a specific protein that exists in the body called Interleukin-18. Interleukin-18 works within the immune system, i.e. the body's defence system, which helps protect it from disease, bacteria and viruses. Interleukin-18 activates the immune system to fight infections and may also occasionally cause inflammation.

","      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with rituximab (anti-CD20,      Rituxan®, MabThera®) in individuals who develop new anti-HLA antibodies after renal (kidney)      transplant will promote longer-term survival of the transplanted kidney.The pilot study      compares the use of rituximab (Rituxan®) + site-specific standard immunosuppression to      placebo + site-specific standard immunosuppression in the treatment of circulating anti-HLA      antibodies in subjects who develop de novo anti-HLA antibodies between 3-36 months after      transplant.    ","      Organ rejection occurs when a patient's body does not recognize the new organ and attacks it.      Data suggest that the development of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies is an      early clinical indication that organ rejection may occur. Rituximab is a genetically      engineered monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen on B cells and is known to      deplete B cells when administered intravenously; it is FDA-approved for the treatment of      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL); and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in      combination with methotrexate in adult patients with moderately-to severely-active RA who      have inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies.      In a previous small study, kidney transplant patients with either acute humoral rejection      (AHR) or chronic humoral rejection (CHR) were given rituximab and other antilymphocyte      therapy. Patients with AHR had lower or undetectable levels of circulating anti-HLA      antibodies after study treatment, and patients with CHR had a sustained decrease of anti-HLA      antibodies to undetectable after 6 to 9 months.      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of rituximab in 1.)preventing organ      rejection and 2.)promoting long-term survival of donor kidneys in people who undergo kidney      transplantation.      This study involves two stages:        1. Stage 1 begins 3 to 36 months after transplant. During Stage 1, blood collection will           occur every 3 months for up to 36 months after transplant to test for anti-HLA           antibodies. When these antibodies are detected twice within 1 month, the patient will           undergo a baseline kidney biopsy and have his or her glomerular filtration rate (GFR)           measured to determine kidney function. If a patient meets certain study criteria, he or           she will enter Stage 2 (Pilot Treatment Study).           If anti-HLA antibodies are not detected in a patient's blood during Stage 1, the           patient's participation will be complete.        2. In Stage 2, patients will receive site-specific standard immunosuppression plus           randomization to either rituximab or placebo:             -  Adult dosing (>18 years of age), will receive an intravenous infusion of 1000mg of                rituximab on Days 0 and 14.             -  Pediatric dosing (<\= than 18 years of age) will receive an intravenous infusion of                375 mg/m^2/dose (maximum 500 mg/dose) in 4 doses of rituximab on Days 0, 8, 15 and                22.      Adult participants will have 7-9 study visits over 12-24 months. Pediatric participants will      have 9-11 study visits over 12-24 months. A physical exam, medication history, adverse events      assessment, and blood and urine collection will occur at all visits. A biopsy of the kidney      transplant will occur at Stage 2 entry and Month 12.      Note: Prior to January 2010, Stage 2 of this was a double-blind (double-masked) randomized      pilot treatment study. As of January 2010 and beyond:        -  subjects were no longer being recruited in the placebo treatment arm        -  all treatment assignments were unblinded and an open-label design commenced; therefore,           medication assignments were open to the study participants as well as to the site           clinical team.        -  all study subjects who participated in the study prior to this change were informed of           the change        -  all subjects who were randomized to the placebo-controlled arm and continued to meet the           pilot study eligibility criteria were provided the option to participate in the pilot           treatment study.

","      Hypothesis: If the use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is proven to be effective in      controlling high blood pressure, it may lead to a reduction of standard therapy and improved      cardiovascular and kidney protection.    ","      Hypertension remains a global burden in cardiovascular disease leading to stroke, myocardial      infarction, and heart failure. Its myocardial complications result from increased mechanical      load on the heart. Under physiological conditions of increased myocardial load and resulting      myocardial stretch, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)      synthesis and secretion occur contributing to maintenance of optimal cardiorenal and blood      pressure homeostasis. However, studies indicate that in subjects with cardiovascular diseases      the biological structure of these hormones may be altered, thus reducing their favorable      protective activities. New studies indicate that early and moderate hypertension is      associated with a derangement of the natriuretic peptide system which is characterized by the      lack of activation of biologically active ANP and BNP, while severe hypertension is      characterized by cardiac release of altered molecular forms of ANP and BNP that have reduced      biological properties and/or enhanced degradation.      The broad objective of proposal is to advance the biology and therapeutics of the natriuretic      peptides (NPs) with a special focus on the cardiac peptide BNP in human hypertension. The      investigators' proposal is based upon the biological properties of BNP (i.e., natriuretic,      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone suppressing, vasodilating, anti-fibrotic, anti-hypertrophic and      positive lusitropic), its mechanistic role in human hypertension, and thus its potential as      an innovative chronic protein therapeutic to enhance the treatment of patients with      uncontrolled and or resistant hypertension. Importantly, BNP is an endocrine hormone normally      produced by the human heart, and its use as therapeutic agent has been approved in USA for      more than a decade and has been proven to be safe.

CD19 targeted CAR T Cell Therapy
This is a personalized therapeutic approach that entails removal of T cells from patient's peripheral blood, genetic modification, activation and expansion in vitro to retarget cells against CD19 protein on the surface of B cells, and infusion of the genetically engineered cells back into the patient. CD19 is a surface protein that is expressed on B cells starting from early pre-B cells to mature fully differentiated B cells. Therefore, CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy can effectively treat refractory B cell lymphomas.

Anyone diagnosed with a      minor stroke faces the possibility of long-term disability and even death, regardless of      treatment. Stroke symptoms such as weakness, difficulty speaking and paralysis may improve or      worsen over the hours or days immediately following a stroke. TEMPO-2 is a minor stroke trial      for patients presenting within 12 hours of their symptom onset. Patients will be randomized      to TNK-tPA or standard of care.

[DVT prophylaxis dosing shall not prohibit enrolment]. For low molecular weight                  heparins (LMWH) more than 48 hours off drug will be considered sufficient to                  allow trial enrollment. For direct oral anticoagulants; in patients with normal                  renal function more than 48 hours off drug will be considered sufficient to allow                  trial enrollment. Patients on direct oral anticoagulants who have any degree of                  renal impairment should not be enrolled in the trial unless they have not taken a                  dose of the drug in the last 5 days.

","      Diabetic lower extremity arterial disease ( DLEAD ), is a common complication of type 2      diabetes. However, DLEAD remains less studied than other diabetic vascular complications; and      only few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have dealt with major lower-limb adverse events      as prespecified endpoints. Studies have suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)      analogues have a protective effect on the development of atherosclerosis, potentially      mediated via the GLP-1 receptors expressed on endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and in      monocytes/macrophages. The investigators aim to evaluate the improvement of lower extremity      ischemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated with lower limb vascular      lesions after liraglutide, compared with the standard-of-care treatment group.    ","      GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that mediates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Accumulating      data from both animal and human studies confirmed a beneficial effect of GLP-1 on myocardium,      endothelium and vasculature, suggesting the potential ameliorative effect of peripheral      atherosclerosis. In our preliminary studies shown that liraglutide, a long-acting GLP-1R      agonist (GLP1RA), stimulate endothelial proliferation and angiogenesis. The study aims to      test the hypothesis that sustained activation of the GLP-1R enhances microvascular perfusion,      promotes angiogenesis, leading to increased walking distance and limb perfusion in diabetes      patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to      with or without liraglutide treatment by a 6-month follow-up. The primary endpoints are the      change in initial and absolute claudication distance and assessment of limb ischemia at 6      months compared with baseline. This trial will collect important mechanistic and clinical      information on the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in T2DM patients with PAD.    ",,"

Assess the effects on ABI of a six month treatment with Liraglutide compared to control group (standard-of-care treatment).
24 weeks
ankle-brachial index is ratio of ankle systolic pressure to arm systolic pressure: using a 10-12 cm sphygmomanometer cuff placed just above the ankle and a doppler instrument used to measure the systolic pressure of the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries of each leg. These pressures are then normalized to the higher brachial pressure of either arm to form the ankle-brachial index (ABI). The index leg is often defined as the leg with the lower ABI.

",      Today Alzheimers disease can not be cured. Animal experiments have shown that the hormone      GLP-1 can improve memory in Alzheimer-prone mice.      The investigators hypothesis is that a 6-month treatment with the GLP-1 receptor stimulating      drug liraglutide will reduce the intracerebral amyloid deposition in the central nervous      system (CNS) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and thereby reduce the clinical      symptoms of the disease.    ,"      The incidences of both type 2 diabetes (DM-2) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have increased      during the last years, resulting in an increase in morbidity and mortality. DM-2 is a risk      factor for both AD and vascular dementia. In addition, an increased incidence of DM-2 in      Alzheimer's patients has been observed. The understanding of the underlying mechanism behind      this linkage is so far very sparse.      In both diseases premature cell degeneration develops. DM-2 is characterized by a loss of      β-cell function and β cell mass in the pancreas, whereas AD shows a loss of neuronal function      as well as neuronal cell death. General metabolic risk factors such as hyperglycemia and      hypercholesterolemia are evident in both diseases.      Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with numerous documented effects on      the glycaemic response. It is released as a response to food ingestion and consequently      exerts a glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion while inhibiting glucagon      secretion. In animal experiments as well as cell experiments β-cell neogenesis, growth and      differentiation are stimulated by GLP-1, and inhibition of β-cell apoptosis has been      demonstrated in cell studies. In addition to α- and β-cells of the pancreas, GLP-1 receptors      (GLP-1R) have been localized to the CNS, where GLP-1R are distributed corresponding to the      hypothalamus and hippocampus. Experimental investigations on mice where GLP-1 was given      intra-cerebroventricularly, GLP-1R stimulation reduced nerve cell damage caused by neurotoxic      stimuli. Furthermore, GLP-1R stimulation in hippocampus induced learning ability and memory      and it has been shown that GLP-1R stimulation leeds to neurite outgrowth and protects against      nerve cell apoptosis.      In connection with hyperinsulinaemia in early stages of DM-2, studies suggest that      stimulation of insulin receptors represented in the brain produce an increased level of      β-amyloid and an increased number of neurofibrillary tangles. AD is pathologically      characterized by an increased level of β-amyloid as well as an increased number of      neurofibrillar tangles. Accumulation of β-amyloid in the brain is localized to areas with      cognitive functions. A recent animal experimental work has shown reduced memory in GLP-1      receptor KO mice and mentions the lack of a possible neuroprotective effect as a potential      explanation for the observation. In studies of humans a worsening of the cognitive functions      has been shown to be associated with dementia and DM-2, even though an actual causal relation      has not yet been found. The investigators have recently shown that GLP-1 has a      neuroprotective function in patients with DM-2.      Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning has been well evaluated in clinical demonstration      of CNS changes following AD including changes in amyloid deposits.      Presently there are no registered drugs which change the deposition of amyloid and there are      no drugs with convincing effect on the progression of the disease in patients with      Alzheimer's. Moreover the drugs which have been marketed for treatment have a disadvantageous      side effect profile. Besides insulin, β-cells secrete amylin, amyloid or IAPP (islet amyloid      polypeptide) and these thus share certain characteristics with β-amyloid. Previously IAPP was      considered to be non-toxic but recent studies have indicated a possible conversion to toxic      β-amyloid.      The insulin-producing β-cells have been found to be characterized by accumulation of amyloid      in several DM-2 models. A recent study with treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors (increasing      endogenous GLP-1) improved glucose tolerance, increased GLP-1 levels and normalized the      topography of the islets of Langerhans in a mouse model with β cell specific over expression      of human amyloid.      The investigators hypothesis is that a 26 week treatment with the GLP-1 receptor stimulating      pharmaceutical liraglutide will reduce the intracerebral amyloid deposition in the CNS in      patients with Alzheimer's disease, as demonstrated by PET.      The investigators aim is that this clinical study will be able to give new information about      the effect of the GLP-1 axis in the CNS and explore the potential for treatment of large      groups of patients who cannot be offered effective drugs today. Altogether the results from      the studies will contribute to the development of future treatment options for AD.    ",,"

Compare the neutralising antibody      development and cell-mediated immune response and identify any adverse events and laboratory      toxicities.    ","      This is an open-label, non-randomised, single centre study of intravenous reovirus      (Reolysin®) with or without Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) given      to patients prior to surgery for metastatic melanoma. Patients will be eligible if undergoing      surgery for local control of lymph node involvement (with or without stage 4 metastases) or      if planned for resection of cutaneous, subcutaneous, musculoskeletal or visceral metastases      for local control, palliation of symptoms or personal choice.      All patients will receive an initial low 'immunisation' dose of intravenous reovirus (1x108      TCID50), to ensure that neutralising antibody (NAB) levels have risen by the time a full      cycle of reovirus +/- GM-CSF is given. All patients will receive only 1 cycle of treatment      which will comprise: i) For reovirus alone patients (Group A), 1x1010 TCID50 as a 1-hour IV      infusion on 2 consecutive days; ii) For reovirus plus GM-CSF patients (Group B), subcutaneous      GM-CSF (50mcg/day) for 3 days, followed by 2 days of reovirus. Both doses of reovirus will be      at 1x1010 TCID50.      Patients will be enrolled sequentially into each of the two cohorts receiving intravenous      reovirus alone, or reovirus plus GM-CSF. The addition of GM-CSF is designed to address      effects on the translational objectives/endpoints of this study, rather than primary      toxicity, although all patients will be monitored for safety. Clinical assessment will be      performed at screening (within 14 days of start of treatment), at day 1 (1st GM-CSF      dose/none), day 8 and at the final study visit (40 days (+/- 14 days) post treatment with      reovirus). Safety bloods will be taken at screening, at treatment (Day 1), before each dose      of reovirus (Day 4 & 5), at Day 8 and at the final study visit (Day 40). Immunological      assays, including reovirus antibody levels, will be performed before low-dose reovirus      priming (Day -10 to -6), pre-treatment on Day 1, on Day 4 and 5 (pre-reovirus infusion and 60      minutes post-infusion), Day 8, and at the final study visit (Day 40). Patients with      accessible skin or subcutaneous metastases will be asked for an optional additional      pre-treatment biopsy which will be taken before low-dose reovirus priming.      All procedures will be performed as an outpatient or day case, apart from surgery in melanoma      patients requiring admission as part of standard clinical care. Imaging will be as for      standard clinical care only. Following surgical resection the tumour will be assessed for      viral status and anti-tumour effects by e.g. standard histology, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR      and electron microscopy. Further imaging and follow-up beyond the final study visit (Day 40      +/- 14 days) will be as for standard clinical care only.    ","

","      Phase III clinical trial, multicenter, controlled, randomized, double-blind, with two      parallel groups (experimental and control). Both study groups will receive standard therapy      currently available in treatment centers for diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). Associate with the      standard therapy, it will be given the recombinant human Epidermal Growth Factor (rhEGF) to      experimental group and in the control group, it will be given a formulation without      pharmacological effect (placebo) in order to masking and control of intralesional      application. Participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) diagnosed with DFU      for at least 4 weeks, treated in referral centers participating in the study, agreeing to      participate after reading, understanding and signing of Informed Consent (IC); meet all the      inclusion criteria; and presenting no exclusion criteria. The Informed Consent (IC) should be      applied to potential participants, as recommended by the regulations and ethical consensus      before beginning any procedure related to the clinical trial. In the early weeks,      participants will be evaluated at the research centers by the study team (doctors and / or      staff). The number of visits will be determined by the investigator, thus ensuring      appropriate assistance to participants, and avoiding any complications with DFU. By meeting      the eligibility requirements (inclusion and exclusion criteria), the participant will undergo      a thorough evaluation of the DFU before the start of treatment. This assessment is precisely      to classify the condition of the ulcer before treatment and provide relevant information for      statistical analysis of the protocol. If eligible, the participant will be randomly set to      treatment arm (placebo or rhEGF) and the administration of investigational product associated      with predefined standardized outpatient therapy will be initiated. This administration occurs      three times per week until the DFU is scarred, not exceeding 8 weeks of treatment (T.01 to      T.08) .The study will be randomized and balanced according to the type and size of the DFU.      This balancing is necessary to ensure that both treatment groups are homogeneous for      participants under different conditions. All participants will be applied established      standard therapy for the treatment of DFU. The objective is to provide regular care for      healing and reduce possible bias in the efficacy analysis and product safety. After the      treatment period (last dose of the experimental drug) the participant will start the      follow-up period, with 16 weeks duration. The participant shall be subjected to weekly visits      for ongoing assessment of DFU, however, according to the investigator, may result in      unscheduled visits to assess local or general clinical events. After the monitoring period,      the participant will be observed for 24 additional weeks, visits every 4 weeks (E.01 E.24 a)      having beginning one week after the last visit of follow-up. This period is intended to      assess possible events related to the efficacy and safety that can happen in the period,      mainly for analysis of secondary endpoints.    ",,,"

","      OBJECTIVES:      Primary Objectives      1.To evaluate the safety and feasibility of the sequential use of a DNA methyltransferase      (DNMT) inhibitor (decitabine) with a targeted biological agent against EGFR (panitumumab) for      KRAS wild type tumors in the second or third line treatment of advanced metastatic colorectal      cancer.      Secondary Objectives        1. To examine re-expression or a reduction in promoter methylation in genes involved in           tumor suppressor pathways known to be important in colorectal cancer (CRC) or involved           in EGFR signaling pathway.        2. Evaluate overall response (OR = CR +PR) according to RECIST criteria at 2, 4, and 6           cycles. Progression free survival, measured as the first evidence of tumor growth from           the start of treatment will also be assessed.        3. Measure CEA levels at the beginning of each cycle to examine if they correlate with           treatment response or disease progression.    ","      Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are living longer and running out of therapeutic      options due to disease resistance. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been validated      as a therapeutic target in colorectal cancer (CRC). Ligand binding to EGFR activates the      RAS/RAF/MAPK, STAT, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, which together modulate cellular      proliferation, adhesion, migration, and survival. Anti-EGFR targeted antibodies cetuximab and      panitumumab administered as monotherapy in CRC have shown response rates of approximately 9%      and 17% respectively (Amado et al., 2008; Saltz et al., 2004). Single agent panitumumab has      been approved for use in third line colorectal cancer and has been shown improve progression      free survival over supportive care. Further subset analysis showed the response rate of 17%      was confined to patients with KRAS wild type tumors only and that this group (approximately      60-70% of all CRC patients) should be considered for further study (Amado et al., 2008).      According to the Huntsman Cancer Hospital registry, colorectal cancer patients are the      largest disease group within our gastrointestinal cancer group and many have or eventually      will progress on available therapy or are or will become intolerant to the side effects of      second line therapies such as oxaliplatin neuropathy or irinotecan induced diarrhea, yet      still are candidates for treatment.      In the lab through translational research studies, we hope to identify re-expression or a      reduction in promoter methylation of genes involved in tumor suppressor pathways known to be      important in colorectal cancer (CRC) or involved in EGFR signaling pathway. Candidate genes      we will evaluate will include genes described in prior studies as associated with the CpG      island methylator phenotype (CIMP) as well as genes previously reported to be hypermethylated      in association with colorectal neoplasia. These will include APC, SFRP family members, CDH-1      (e-cadherin) and p16 (Belshaw et al., 2008; Lind et al., 2004; Suehiro et al., 2008). Other      genes more specific to EGFR or KRAS signaling that will be assessed include: RASSF1A , a      tumor suppressor gene know to be hypermethylated in several human cancers including CRC, is      occasionally associated with KRAS wild type and when silenced by methylation allows for RAS      activation (Kang et al., 2006; Oliveira et al., 2005); SOX17, a member of the transcription      factor superfamily know to be hypermethylated in CRC and lead to disrupted Wnt signaling      (Zhang et al., 2008); SOCS-1 a negative regulator of STAT3 an activating ligand for EGFR that      has been shown to be silenced by hypermethylation and allow for constitutive signaling via      EGFR (Lee et al., 2006); and PTEN, a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the PI3K- AKT/PKB      signaling pathway by dephosphorylating phosphoinositides (Noro et al., 2007). Further      candidate genes may be discovered or added based on preliminary data and ongoing research.      Methylation analysis and gene expression pattern changes will be done using methylation      specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing of genes known to be involved in EGFR signaling      pathways and colorectal neoplasia as described above. We have prior data from our own work as      well as others to suggest the use of a hypomethylating agent can resensitize colon cancer      cells to therapeutic agents (Karpf et al., 1999; Morita et al., 2006). The translational      component of this research will be supported by institutional translational grant awarded to      the PI, Kimberly Jones, as of July 1st, 2008. This information may help identify other      important targets and allow for the design of better combination therapies. We plan to do      these assays on weekly blood and buccal samples while patients are on therapy, on epithelial      cells swabbed from panitumumab associated skin rash, and on archived or biopsied tumor      specimens when available (from KRAS testing (required) and optional end-of treatment biopsy).      The pharmacokinetic profile for decitabine has been well described and offers several      possible dosing schedules feasible for clinical practice and combination with other agents.      Decitabine is currently being tested in combination with standard cytotoxic agents. It has      shown some activity in solid tumors, however, myelosuppression is a common side effect,      especially when given concurrently with other myelosuppressive therapy (carboplatin)      (Appleton et al., 2007; Plimack et al., 2007). We propose a novel study using decitabine in      combination with a non-myelosuppressive targeted biological agent as well as giving it      sequentially rather than concurrently to try to maximize the effect of the second drug by      dosing it during the demethylation window. In the dose-finding study reported by Appleton et      al., they recommended a dose of 90 mg/m2 over 6 hours every 28 days, but went up as high as      135 mg/m2 and combined this with carboplatin (Appleton et al., 2007). We have chosen a dose      of 45 mg/m2 decitabine every 14 days based on its reported safety and biological equivalence      from this study. There was no grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicities observed with 3 patients      infused with 45 mg/m2 of decitabine followed by 5 AUC carboplatin; there was 1 episode of      grade 3 leukopenia and 1 of grade 3 neutropenia in 4 patients infused with 45 mg/m2 of      decitabine followed by 6 AUC carboplatin (Appleton et al., 2007). At the higher dose of 90      mg/m2 with 5 AUC carboplatin in 13 patients, 5 episodes of grade 4 leukopenia or neutropenia      were observed; in 10 patients with 90 mg/m2 and 6 AUC carboplatin, there were 4 episodes of      grade 4 leukopenia or neutropenia. The proposed infusion over 2 hours should not create any      infusion rate toxicities and will be a schedule patients will tolerate. Daily lower dose      infusions used in hematological disorders maybe be efficacious but daily intravenous      chemotherapy impacts patient's quality of life significantly. Decitabine also has an      elimination half-life of 30 minutes, so will clear the body rapidly. The proposed      administration of the decitabine twice, at half the dose, in a 28-day period should be better      tolerated than the 90 mg/m2 combined with carboplatin. The myelosuppressive toxicity which is      the main toxicity of decitabine should be less significant as it is not being combined with a      second myelosuppressive agent as it was with carboplatin. Low dose decitabine (45 mg/m2) has      nearly equivalent hypomethylating effects to 90 mg/m2 in both blood and buccal cells. The      more frequent dosing (every 2 weeks versus every 4 weeks) should maintain the hypomethylating      effect at a lower dose. Additionally, we propose a novel dosing schedule where our second      agent, panitumumab, will be given on alternating weeks and targeting the EGFR pathway when it      is hypomethylated from the prior decitabine treatment. Our work as well as others, has      demonstrated that specific promoter hypomethylation is observed by 8-14 days after the start      of treatment and genomic DNA reverts to baseline levels by 28 to 35 days after the start of      treatment (Appleton et al., 2007; Samlowski et al., 2005, Kantarjian, 2007 #23).      We will also be assessing clinical response and progression free survival (PFS) and comparing      it to historical controls of patients treated with panitumumab monotherapy. If the      combination can be given safely and responses are seen that are equal to or better than the      single agent panitumumab data, we would plan a multi-center larger phase II trial.    ",,"

","      Background      GD2 is a well-characterized tumor antigen in neuroblastoma, which is also expressed on      osteosarcomas and some other sarcomas. T cells expressing 1st generation anti-GD2 chimeric      antigen receptors (CARs) were safe and mediated modest antitumor activity in some patients      with refractory neuroblastoma.      A 3rd generation anti-GD2-CAR (GD2-CAR.OX40.28.z.ICD9) has been produced and holds promise      for increased activity compared to the 1st generation GD2-CAR already studied in clinical      trials. As an added safety measure, the vector includes a suicide switch comprising a caspase      dimerization domain (ICD9) that can be activated by a small molecule to induce death of the      genetically engineered cells if they were induce untoward toxicity.      Objectives      Primary:Determine the feasibility of producing anti GD2-CAR cells meeting the established      release criteria and to assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-GD2-CAR      engineered T cells in children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors, including      neuroblastoma, following cyclophosphamide-based lymphodepletion.      Secondary:        1. Determine if administration anti-GD2-CAR engineered T cells mediate antitumor effects in           children and young adults with GD2+ solid tumors;        2. Measure persistence of adoptively transferred anti-GD2-CAR T cells and correlate this           with antitumor effects;        3. Extend information regarding the prevalence and intensity of GD2 expression in           non-neuroblastoma, non-osteosarcoma solid tumors in children and young adults;        4. If unacceptable toxicity occurs that is possibly, probably or likely related to           anti-GD2-CAR T cells, assess the capacity for AP1903, a dimerizing agent, to mediate           clearance of the genetically engineered cells and resolve toxicity; and        5. Assess toxicity of AP1903 if administered to mediate clearance of anti-GD2-CAR T cells.      Eligibility      Patients 1-35 years of age, at least 15 kg, with osteosarcoma or a GD2+ solid tumor      (including neuroblastoma) that has recurred after or not responded to standard therapy and is      deemed incurable by standard therapy.      Design      After apheresis to collect T cells for transduction, patients receive cyclophosphamide      1800mg/m(2)/d as a lymphodepleting regimen. A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will used      at 4 dose levels (1 x 10(5) transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 10(6) transduced T cells/kg; 3 x 10(6)      transduced T cells/kg; and 1 x 10(7) transduced T cells/kg), using a standard 3 plus 3 dose      escalation design. An expanded group of a total of 12 patients will be treated at the highest      dose, comprising at least 6 osteosarcoma patients.      Patients will be monitored for toxicity, antitumor effects and persistence of anti-GD2-CAR T      cells.      Patients with a PR, SD may receive a 2nd cycle at the next higher dose level a minimum of 60      days following completion of the first cycle if eligibility criteria are met.      A maximum of 36 patients may be treated on this study. Given that there is likelihood that      some patients with non-osteosarcoma will not meet the criteria for GD2 expression to be      eligible for enrollment, up to 72 subjects will be screened to enroll a maximum of 36      patients for treatment. Up to 2-3 patients will be accrued per month, and therefore this      study may require up to 2-3 years to complete enrollment and treatment.

Diagnosis                  (a) Osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and melanoma that have been treated with standard                  frontline therapy and are judged to be incurable with standard therapy, based                  upon the fact that they are unresectable, metastatic, progressive/persistent or                  recurrent.                  Evaluable disease must be present.                  i) For all histologies except osteosarcoma and neuroblastoma, pathologic review                  of frozen tissue must document GD2+ expression. Positive expression is defined as                  at least 2+ expression (0-4+ scale) in >50 percent of the tumor cells using                  anti-GD2 mAb 14G2a. If adequate archived frozen tissue is available, this may be                  utilized, or if not, patients may undergo biopsy following enrollment to obtain                  tissue to assess GD2 expression, with the following restrictions.                  ii) Patients with histologies other than osteosarcoma or neuroblastoma must have                  adequate accessible tumor for biopsy (at least 1 cm diameter).                  iii) Procedures employed to acquire biopsies for tumor lysates will be limited to                  percutaneous needle or core biopsies, thoracoscopic excision or open biopsies of                  readily accessible lesions. Pulmonary lesions may be biopsied but extensive                  surgery such as thoracotomy or laparotomy should not be employed.                  iv) Patients who will require biopsy should not be enrolled if in the opinion of                  the principal investigator, the tumor site places the patient at substantial risk                  from the biopsy procedure.               2.

","      Background:        -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is a procedure that           transplants bone marrow cells (stem cells) from a matching donor into a recipient in           order to allow the donor stem cells to produce cells that will attack the recipient s           cancer cells. AlloHSCT is performed when chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation           therapy do not adequately control cancer growth. However, cancers that are not           controlled by alloHSCT frequently become resistant to other standard treatment options.        -  The outcomes of alloHSCT might be improved if certain kinds of white blood cells (T           cells) could be manipulated so that they generate a more potent effect against the           cancer cells. This effect can be augmented by genetically engineering donor T cells to           specifically recognize cancerous cells in order to attack them. For this purpose,           researchers are studying a specific kind of genetically engineered T cell known as the           anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell. More research is needed to determine if this T cell           will be an effective treatment for certain kinds of B cell cancer (such as non-Hodgkin s           lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) that has not been controlled with alloHSCT.      Objectives:      - To assess the safety and effectiveness of administering allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced      T cells to patients with B-cell cancer that has not responded to alloHSCT.      Eligibility:        -  Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who have received allogeneic hematopoietic           stem cell transplantation for a B cell cancer, but whose cancer has either not responded           to or recurred after the transplant.        -  Recipients must have the same stem cell donor from their previous procedure.      Design:        -  Before the start of the study, all participants will be screened with a medical history           and blood tests. Recipients will have tumor imaging scans, additional blood tests, and           other tests as directed by the study doctors.        -  Donor participants will undergo apheresis to provide white blood cells for researchers           to use in the treatment.        -  Recipients will have dose escalation to determine the most effective yet safe dose of           anti-CD19 T cells. There will be six dose levels of anti-CD19 T cells. The first           patients enrolled will have the smallest dose, and the dose will be increased when a           level has been determined to be safe. .        -  Recipients will be hospitalized for at least 9 days after receiving the cell infusion,           and will need to come to clinic for follow-up visits 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the           infusion.        -  Additional scans and frequent blood tests will be required for the first 3 months after           the infusion, followed by less frequent visits over time.        -  Recipients will be followed for a maximum of 15 years after receiving the infusion.    ","      Background:      Many patients with advanced B-cell malignancies that cannot be cured by chemotherapy and      monoclonal antibodies have prolonged relapse-free survival after allogeneic hematopoietic      stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT); however, a substantial fraction of patients with B-cell      malignancies relapse following alloHSCT.      The first therapeutic maneuver attempted when patients without graft-versus-host disease      (GVHD) relapse after alloHSCT is usually withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs. If a      remission does not occur after withdrawal of immunosuppression, patients are often treated      with lymphocyte -DCI. Withdrawal of immunosuppression and DCI can lead to complete remissions      in patients with B-cell malignancies that relapse after alloHSCT. Unfortunately, a      substantial fraction of patients do not enter a complete remission after withdrawal of      immunosuppression followed by DCI, and these therapies are often complicated by GVHD.      The outcomes of alloHSCT might be improved if T cells could be manipulated so that they      generate a more potent graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effect than unmanipulated T cells.      We hypothesize that the GVM effect against B-cell malignancies can be augmented by      genetically engineering donor T cells to express receptors that specifically recognize      antigens expressed by malignant B cells.      Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) consist of an antigen recognition moiety combined with      T-cell signaling domains. CARs are capable of activating T cells in an antigen-specific      manner.      Expression of the CD19 antigen is limited to B cells and perhaps follicular dendritic cells.      Most malignant B cells express CD19.      We have constructed a retroviral vector encoding an anti-CD19 CAR. Large numbers of T cells      that have been transduced with this retroviral vector can be generated in vitro for clinical      adoptive T cell therapy. These anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells specifically recognize a      variety of CD19+ target cells and kill primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in      vitro.      Primary Objective:      To assess the safety of administering allogeneic anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells to patients      with B-cell malignancies that are persistent or relapsed after alloHSCT. The allogeneic      anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells will be derived from the original allogeneic transplant      donor.      Eligibility:      Patients with any CD19-expressing malignancy that is persistent or recurrent following      successful engraftment after HLA-identical or >=9/10 matched sibling, 1-antigen mismatched      sibling, or 9/10-matched unrelated donor (URD) alloHSCT and withdrawal of immunosuppression.      The same donor that provided cells for the alloHSCT must be willing and able to undergo      leukapheresis so that cells can be obtained to prepare the anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cells.      The recipient must have at most grade I acute GVHD or chronic GVHD with no organ site with a      score exceeding 1, except for the skin, for which a score of 1 or 2 will be allowable. The      recipient must not have received systemic immunosuppressive drugs given for graft versus host      disease for at least 28 days at the time of study enrollment. Patients must be on a dose of      corticosteroids of an equivalent of 5 mg/day or less of prednisone. Corticosteroid creams,      ointments, and eye drops are allowed.      Design:      The alloHSCT donor will undergo leukapheresis.      Patients will undergo apheresis to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These cells      will be processed to produce anti-CD19 CAR stem memory T cells (anti-CD19 CAR Tscm). This      process involves sorting the cells and then culturing the cells in vitro for 9 days. During      the 9-day culture period, the cells will be transduced with gammaretroviruses encoding the      FMC63-28Z.      CAR recipients will be monitored for development of acute treatment-related toxicities for at      least 9 days after cell infusion as inpatients. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will include      severe acute GVHD and Grade 4 toxicities not associated with GVHD.      A maximum of 126 evaluable patients (donors plus recipients) will be treated.      Assessment of safety is a primary objective of this clinical trial. Safety will be defined as      a lack of severe acute post-infusional toxicities and an incidence of GVHD that is not higher      than historical rates of GVHD occurring after standard DCI.      Anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T-cell persistence in the peripheral blood will be measured at      multiple time points from 1 week to 1 year after anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell infusion by      flow cytometry.      To assess for an anti-malignancy effect of the infused cells, patients will be staged using      standard staging systems.    ",,"

Exception: Prior (DCI) DLI is not an eligibility requirement for patients with ALL,             Burkitt lyphoma, ALL like high-grade lymphomas, or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.             At least 28 days weeks must have elapsed since the latest trial of withdraw of             immunosuppression or DLI until the patient can be deemed to have persistent disease.          2. CD19 expression must be detected on the majority of the malignant cells by             immunohistochemistry or by flow cytometry in the Laboratory of Pathology, CCR, NCI,             NIH. Definition of which cells are malignant must be determined for each patient by             the Laboratory of Pathology using techniques to demonstrate monoclonality such as             kappa/lambda restriction (other techniques can be used to determine monoclonality at             the discretion of the Laboratory of Pathology). The choice of whether to use flow             cytometry or immuohistochemistry will be determined by what is the most easily             available tissue sample in each patient. Immunohistochemistry will be used for lymph             node biopsies and bone marrow biopsies. Flow cytometry will be used for peripheral             blood, fine needle aspirate, and bone marrow aspirate samples.          3. Patients must be 18-75 years of age.          4.

For patients that have received prior DLI, the last dose must be at             least 28 days prior to anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cell administration. Note that             patients can be enrolled on this study at any time after or during therapy, but at             least 14 days must elapse from the time of prior monoclonal antibody administration or             chemotherapy until anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells are infused, and at least 28 days             must elapse from the time of withdraw of immunosuppression, or DLI, or other             immunomodulatory therapies such as lenalidomide until anti-CD19 CAR-transduced T cells             are infused. Systemic immunosuppression given for graft versus host disease must be             stopped at least 28 days prior to protocol entry. There is no time restriction in             regard to prior intrathecal chemotherapy provided there is complete recovery from any             acute toxic effects of such.          8. Recipients of unrelated donor transplants from a National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP)             Center must sign a release of information form to authorize NMDP transfer of             information to the NIH.          9.

Donor selection will be in accordance with NIH/CC Department of Transfusion Medicine             (DTM) criteria and, in the case of an unrelated donor from a Transplant Center, the             National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) standards. When a potentially eligible recipient             of an unrelated donor product from an NMDP Center is identified, the recipient will             complete an NMDP search transfer request to allow NIH NMDP staff to contact the NMDP             Coordinating Center, who will, in turn, contact the donor s prior Donor Center. The             NMDP Policy for Subsequent Donation Requests will be followed and the appropriate             forms (Subsequent Donation Request form) and Therapeutic T Cell Collection             Prescription will be submitted as required.        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:        Exclusion Criteria: Recipients          1. Active infection that is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.          2. Sero positive for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can             have decreased immune -competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)          3. Sero positive for hepatitis B antigen, positive hepatitis B tests can be further             evaluated by confirmatory tests (HBV DNA), and if confirmatory tests are negative, the             patient can be enrolled.          4. Sero positive for hepatitis C antibody unless antigen negative. If hepatitis C             antibody test is positive, then patients must be tested for the presence of RNA by             RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.          5. Active psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with the treatment             protocol, or which does not allow for appropriate informed consent (as determined by             Principal Investigator and/or his designee).          6. Pregnant or lactating. The effects of the immunosuppressive medications that could be             required to treat GHVD are likely to be harmful to a fetus. The effects upon breast             milk are also unknown and may be harmful to an infant.          7. Serum total bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl, serum ALT and AST values greater than or equal to             2.5 times the upper limit of normal based on age-specific normal values. If the             abnormal liver function is attributable to liver involvement by malignancy, patients             may be eligible with serum total bilirubin up to 5.0 mg/dl, and serum ALT and AST             values up to 5.0 times the upper limit of normal, provided the patient has no evidence             of impending hepatic failure (encephalopathy or prothrombin time >2 times the upper             limit of normal).          8. Serum creatinine greater than 1.6 mg/dL          9. Absolute neutrophil count of less than 1000 cells/microL unless low neutrophil count             is thought to be due to malignancy in the bone marrow and malignancy is documented in             the bone marrow.         10. Active cerebrospinal fluid involvement with malignancy or brain metastasis.         11. Platelet count less than 30,000/microL unless low platelet count is thought to be due             to malignancy in the bone marrow and malignancy is documented in the bone marrow.         12. Hemoglobin less than 8.0 g/dL.         13. Receiving systemic corticosteroids including prednisone, dexamethasone or any other             corticosteroid at doses of higher than 5 mg/day of prednisone within 28 days prior to             anti-CD19-CAR-transduced T cell administration. Corticosteroid creams, ointments, and             eye drops are allowed.         14. Blood blast percentage higher than 5%.        Exclusion Criteria: Donors          1. History of psychiatric disorder which may compromise compliance with this protocol or             which does not allow for appropriate informed consent.          2. History of hypertension that is not controlled by medication, stroke, or severe heart             disease (donors with symptomatic angina will be excluded). Donors with a history of             coronary artery bypass grafting or angioplasty who are symptom free will receive a             cardiology evaluation and be considered on a case-by-case basis.          3. Donors must not be pregnant.          4. Anemia (Hb < 11 gm/dl) or thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100,000 per microL). However,             potential donors with Hb levels < 11 gm/dl that is due to iron deficiency will be             eligible as long as the donor is initiated on iron replacement therapy. The NIH             Clinical Center, Department of Transfusion Medicine/NMDP physicians will determine the             appropriateness of individuals as donors.

","      Background:      Human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical, throat, anal, and genital cancers. Cancers      caused by HPV have a HPV protein called E7 inside of their cells. In this new therapy,      researchers take a person s blood, remove certain white blood cells, and insert genes that      make them to target cancer cells that have the E7 protein. The genetically changed cells,      called E7 TCR cells, are then given back to the person to fight the cancer. Researchers want      to see if this can help people.      Objective:      To determine a safe dose and efficacy of E7 TCR cells and whether these cells can help      patients.      Eligibility:      Adults ages 18 and older with an HPV-16-associated cancer, including cervical, vulvar,      vaginal, penile, anal, or oropharyngeal.      Design:      Participants will list all their medicines.      Participants will have many screening tests, including imaging procedures, heart and lung      tests, and lab tests. They will have a large catheter inserted into a vein.      Participants will have leukapheresis. Blood will be removed through a needle in the arm. A      machine separates the white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle      in the other arm.      The cells will be changed in the lab.      Participants will stay in the hospital. Over several days, they will get:      Chemotherapy drugs      E7 TCR cells      Shots or injections to stimulate the cells      Participants will be monitored in the hospital up to 12 days. They will get support medicine      and have blood and lab tests.      Participants will have a clinic visit about 40 days after cell infusion. They will have a      physical exam, blood work, scans, and maybe x-rays.      Participants will have many follow-up visits with the same procedures. At some visits, they      may undergo leukapheresis.      Participants will be followed for 15 years.    ","      Background:        -  Metastatic or refractory/recurrent human papillomavirus (HPV)-16+ cancers (cervical,           vulvar, vaginal, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers) are incurable and poorly           palliated by standard therapies.        -  HPV-16+ cancers constitutively express the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein, which is absent from           healthy human tissues.        -  Administration of T cell receptor (TCR) gene engineered T cells can induce objective           tumor responses in certain malignancies including HPV-16+ cancers.        -  T cells genetically engineered with a TCR targeting HPV-16 E7 (E7 TCR) display specific           reactivity against HLA-A2+, HPV-16+ target cells.      Objectives:      Phase I Primary Objective      - To determine a safe dose for E7 TCR cells plus aldesleukin for the treatment of metastatic      HPV-16+ cancers.      Phase II Primary Objective      -To determine safety and efficacy of E7 TCR cells plus aldesleukin for the treatment of      metastatic HPV-16+ cancers.      Eligibility:        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years old with metastatic or refractory/recurrent           HPV-16+ cancer.        -  Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the patient declines standard           treatment.        -  Patients must be HLA-A*02:01-positive.      Design:        -  This is a phase I/II clinical trial that will test the safety and efficacy of E7 TCR           cells.        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte-depleting preparative regimen           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by a single infusion of E7 TCR cells. Cell           infusion will be followed by high-dose aldesleukin.        -  Re-enrollment will be allowed for a small number of subjects.    ",,"

Measurable metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV-16+ cancer (determined by in                  situ hybridization (ISH) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based test).               2. Patients must be HLA-A*02 by low resolution typing, and HLA-A*02:01 by one of the                  high resolution type results.               3. All patients must have received prior first line standard therapy or declined                  standard therapy.               4. Patients with three or fewer brain metastases that have been treated with surgery                  or stereotactic radiosurgery are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with                  stereotactic radiosurgery must be clinically stable for one month before protocol                  treatment. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.               5. Greater than or equal to 18 years of age.               6. Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document.               7. Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1.               8. Patients of both genders must be willing to practice birth control from the time                  of enrollment on this study up to four months after treatment. Patients must be                  willing to undergo testing for HPV-16 prior to becoming pregnant after this                  period.               9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of                  the potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus. Women of                  childbearing potential are defined as all women except women who are                  postmenopausal or who have had a hysterectomy. Postmenopausal will be defined as                  women over the age of 55 who have not had a menstrual period in at least one                  year. Because there is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants                  secondary to treatment of the mother with E7 TCR transduced PBL, breastfeeding                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with E7 TCR transduced PBL. These                  potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.              10. Serology:          -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in this             protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV seropositive can             have decreased immune-competence and thus are less responsive to the experimental             treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)          -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody. If             hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then the patient must be tested for the             presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.             a.

These methods collectively use      the body's immune system to target the patient's own tumor. Immunosuppression hinders that      response, and may develop in NSCLC patients in a variety of ways, such as activation of      checkpoint pathways in the tumor microenvironment. Drugs that disrupt checkpoint molecule      signaling like anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies nivolumab, may release this brake on the      immune system. Tumor expression of PD-L1 plays an important role in patient response to      checkpoint inhibitors; in general, clinical response to checkpoint inhibitors requires tumor      expression of PD-L1 and presence of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL). Combining      viagenpumatucel-L with anti-PD-1 agents may enhance the vaccine's anti-tumor activity while      prolonging or increasing the efficacy of the checkpoint inhibitor.    ",,"

",,"      This study will examine blood for factors that may cause or prevent diseases involving iron      or red blood cells. Iron is an important nutrient for human health that is needed to produce      red blood cells. Red blood cells carry oxygen to body tissues. A better understanding of iron      and red blood cells may help lead to better treatment of several diseases including anemia.      Patients of all ages with red cell abnormalities in the following categories may be eligible      for this study:        -  Diseases with deficiency, overload or maldistribution of iron        -  Known red blood cell diseases, such as anemias and hemoglobinopathies        -  Red blood cell diseases of unknown cause, such as hemolysis of unknown cause        -  Red blood cell abnormalities with no overt clinical disease, such as hereditary           persistence of fetal hemoglobin      Participants undergo the following procedures:        -  Medical history        -  Physical examination        -  Standard medical tests related to the individual's iron or red blood cell condition      Blood draw for the following purposes:        -  Testing for syphilis and for the hepatitis B and C, HIV, and HTLV-1viruses, and for a           pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant        -  Research purposes. This blood is analyzed for genes, proteins, sugars, and fat           molecules.    ","      Studies of iron and erythroid cells, have provided fundamental insights into structure      function relationships of proteins, energy metabolism, and the molecular basis of many      diseases. Based upon the importance of iron for hemoglobin production, the regulation of      erythropoiesis and iron metabolism are closely linked, and iron deficiency anemia remains as      one of the most common diseases worldwide. The discovery of sickle hemoglobin as having an      abnormal electrophoretic mobility marked the beginning of the molecular medicine era. The      advent of recombinant DNA technology and sequencing methodologies resulted in the      characterization of erythroid cells well beyond that of protein based studies to include gene      structure and expression. Globin gene research, in particular, has provided a wealth of      information about the expression, regulation and insulation of mammalian genes. More      recently, studies of iron absorption and trafficking provided new avenues of research aimed      toward growth and energy homeostasis. Genome based approaches were also utilized for the      discovery of direct relationships between erythroid cell biology and iron homeostasis. Hence,      there is strong evidence that fundamental clinical advances in the field of iron and      erythroid biology have been based upon the careful study of humans with informative      phenotypes. Clinically based correlation of genotype and phenotype is a proven, systematic      approach for understanding the molecular basis of disease.      With the completion of the sequencing of the human genome, a more complete, genetically based      description of disease is now achievable. Efforts aimed toward haplotype mapping will further      enhance genotype phenotype correlation directly from clinical samples. Considerable progress      has already been made in this regard using normal human erythroid cells. In contrast to      classic studies involving single genes or proteins, computational biology and high throughput      technologies permit the analysis of complex erythroid phenotypes including those with related      iron pathologies. This information will be invaluable for understanding those molecular      mechanisms that are altered in disease states.      The immediate aim of this protocol is to perform phenotypic analyses in humans with      informative iron or erythroid phenotypes. These studies are expected to result in detailed      clinical phenotyping and the collection and banking of clinical specimens for further study.      In addition, we predict an ongoing growth of new technologies that may eventually be used for      molecular and genetic phenotyping of clinical samples (examples include oligonucleotide chips      and high throughput mass spectroscopy). Based upon this prediction, we plan to use the      samples collected here to assess possible clinical uses of those technologies as they become      available. The eventual aim is the discovery of identifiers that may be predictive of disease      pathogenesis, severity or clinical response to intervention.    ",,"

Although there are drugs      approved to treat osteoporosis in men [bisphosphonates, denosumab, and teriparatide (TPTD) or      PTH(1-34)], there is a lack of knowledge on how to use them effectively. TPTD is a potent      bone anabolic drug, meaning that it builds bone mass. However, doctors do not know if it      should only be used as single drug or whether it can be more effectively combined to achieve      the most benefit? This trial will test a novel combination therapy for osteoporosis in men      based on exciting laboratory findings in mice. TPTD works to raise bone mass and improve bone      strength by stimulating PTH receptors (PTH-Rs) on the membranes of bone-forming cells or      osteoblasts (OBs). Calcimimetics are drugs that activate calcium receptors (CaSRs) in OBs.      CaSRs in OBs participate in new bone formation. Daily injections of TPTD, given along with a      calcimimetic drug (called NPS-R568), over 6 weeks markedly improved bone mineral density      (BMD) and structure in mice. This study will test whether the combined activation of PTH-Rs      and CaSRs (by the combination treatment of TPTD+calcimimetic cinacalcet) in men will produce      greater bone forming responses than PTH-R activation alone (TPTD+placebo). The study has two      aims and will be done in 48 men with low bone mass: (1) to determine the effects of 11 months      treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet vs TPTD+placebo on BMD and bone metabolism by assessing lumbar      spine BMD (primary endpoint), femoral neck BMD, and levels of the bone formation marker serum      N-terminal pro-peptide of type 1 collagen; (2) to determine the biochemical responses by      blood tests in men who receive the combination of TPTD+cinacalcet compared to men who get      TPTD+placebo treatment. This is done by quantifying acute and chronic changes in serum      calcium and PTH levels right after these drugs are given and how much calcium is excreted in      the urine over time, with both treatment regimens. This study will help to understand whether      an effective combination therapy in mice will prove to be effective in men.    ","      NOVEL COMBINATION THERAPY FOR OSTEOPOROSIS IN MEN        1. Background for the Study           What Is the Risk of Osteoporotic Fractures in Men and Why Do Men Lose Bone Mass?           Osteoporosis is a neglected condition in men. Yet, men sustain approximately 30% of the           1.5 million fractures that occur annually in the US. Fractures are expensive. Estimated           costs are at least $20 billion annually. This figure will no doubt rise substantially as           the population ages. Plus, these costs do not take into account the personal and           societal burden of fractures, especially hip fractures. One in 6 men will sustain a hip           fracture by the time he reaches age 90 years. A man who fractures a hip at any age has           greater disability following that fracture and is much less likely to regain his ability           to walk and to live independently afterward. Men also have a greater risk of dying from           the complications of hip fractures. Overall, one-year mortality for patients who sustain           a hip fracture is ~20%. However, mortality in men with hip fractures is staggeringly           high at ~37.5% in the first year.           The pathophysiology of bone loss in aging men differs in important ways from           postmenopausal osteoporosis. Age-related bone loss in men begins in the 6th decade with           nutritional and hormonal abnormalities playing important roles. Contributing factors           include decreased intestinal Ca absorption, vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency, and           secondary (2o) hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Testosterone levels decline with age in men,           and as they do, estradiol levels also fall. Considerable evidence supports an important           role for estradiol in maintaining bone mass in men as well as women. Men lose both           trabecular and cortical bone mass with age. Trabecular bone thins out in men, rather           than perforates, as it does in women, and excessive cortical bone remodeling is a           dominant force in older men. In men, periosteal bone apposition does not keep pace with           endosteal resorption, and the bones weaken. With minimal trauma, fragility fractures may           result. Thus, reduced bone formation is a key mechanism underlying bone loss in men,           more so than the high rates of bone resorption seen in postmenopausal estrogen           deficiency. For these reasons, anabolic regimens that enhance bone formation may achieve           better clinical outcomes in men compared to commonly used antiresorptive agents. This           trial will test a novel anabolic combination therapy in men.           How Effective Are Current Treatments for Osteoporosis in Men? Several agents have been           Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved to treat osteoporosis in men:           bisphosphonates; denosumab; and teriparatide (TPTD) or parathyroid hormone (PTH) (1-34).           In trials enrolling men, these agents were shown to increase bone mineral density (BMD)           by dual energy Xray absorptiometry (DXA) at key skeletal sites, quantitatively similar           to their effects in postmenopausal women. In only a few appropriately powered studies,           there was a reduction in incident vertebral fractures in men at high risk and/or those           on androgen deprivation therapy.           Intermittent injections of TPTD are appealing as a treatment for osteoporosis in men           because the agent has potent anabolic actions. TPTD increases bone formation, reflected           by enhanced biochemical markers of osteoblast (OB) activity, such as N-terminal           propeptide of type 1 collagen (P1NP) and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) in           the blood, and by direct histomorphometric quantification of bone formation, and mineral           apposition rates. TPTD also improves the microarchitecture of bone by micro-CT           (trabecular thickness and connectivity) and increases the maturation or number of           circulating osteogenic precursors and stem cells in blood in postmenopausal women. TPTD           in vitro stimulates the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells and their commitment to           the OB lineage as osteoprogenitors. PTH (1-34) also increases differentiation of early           OBs and matrix production, blocks apoptosis of OBs and osteocytes, and reduces           production of the Wnt inhibitor sclerostin by osteocytes. The anabolic actions of PTH           treatment within a defined time-frame (18 to 24 months in humans) -- called the           ""anabolic window"" -- improve bone strength and ultimately reduce spine and nonvertebral           fractures. Over time, however, PTH stimulates receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa           B ligand (RANK-L) production by early OB lineage cells, and RANK-L enhances osteoclast           (OC) production. This increases bone resorption, which limits further gains in BMD with           PTH. The challenge in designing optimal treatment regimens with PTH is maximizing its           anabolic activity, while taming its catabolic effects on bone.           Clinical trials with TPTD [recombinant human PTH (1-34)] or synthetic human PTH (1-34)           in men are limited to a few studies with small numbers of men. Orwoll and colleagues           randomized 437 men into 3 groups: placebo (PBO) vs 20 (the dose subsequently           FDA-approved) or 40 ug TPTD daily. However, they completed only an average of 11 months           on treatment. Kurland and colleagues randomized 23 men to synthetic PTH (1-34) (400 IU           or ~25 ug/day; N=10) or PBO (N=13) for 18 months. Finkelstein and colleagues, as part of           a combination study, randomized 27 men to synthetic PTH (1-34) for 24 months (37           ug/day). Thus, that study used twice the approved dose of PTH (1-34). Walker and           colleagues randomized men to risedronate (35 mg/week) (N=10), TPTD (20 ug/day) (N=9), or           the combination (N=10) for 18 months. In these studies, BMD rose by ~6-14% at the lumbar           spine and by ~2-4% at femoral neck with 11-18 months treatment [with 20 or 25 ug PTH           (1-34)/day]. Higher doses of PTH (1-34) (37 or 40 ug/day) produced even greater           responses at both sites (2-3 fold more). This indicates that stronger anabolic effects           are feasible to achieve in men within these short time-frames. However, these doses are           less tolerated, and the investigators do not plan to use them. Rather, the trial           proposed will use the FDA-approved dose of TPTD (20 ug/d) by daily subcutaneous           injection.           Combination studies of PTH (1-34) with alendronate or TPTD with risedronate did not           convincingly show synergistic effects on BMD in men. A trial combining TPTD and           denosumab showed additive effects of the combination, but it was done in women. Several           important questions about TPTD treatment in men have never been addressed. Among them,           can TPTD be advantageously combined with another ""bone-active"" drug that has a similar           or a different mechanism of action? Investigators in the field only know that adding PTH           (1-34) to alendronate in men does not produce additive effects. This trial will test the           hypothesis that concurrent CaSR activation (by calcimimetic) synergizes with PTH-R           activation (by TPTD) to produce greater anabolic effects in men, reflected by changes in           BMD and bone turnover markers (BTMs), compared to TPTD alone. This is a novel           combination therapy that is well-supported in preclinical studies.        2. Scientific Premise for the Planned Intervention This is a first in human study of a           combination therapy for osteoporosis. Both of the drugs that will be used in the trial           have been FDA-approved for many years and have been used in the clinic in hundreds of           thousands of patients worldwide: TPTD for the treatment of osteoporosis in women and           men, and cinacalcet for the treatment of various forms of HPT in women and men. The two           agents to be used in the trial have not been as yet tested in the combination format           that will be done in this study.           Summarized below are preclinical data from young (12-week old) and elderly (12-month           old) male and female mice.           Preclinical Studies: Combined PTH(1-34) and Calcimimetic Produce Marked Anabolic Effects           on Bone in Mice Both extracellular Ca-sensing receptors (CaSRs) and PTH receptors           (PTH-Rs) play central roles in the control of bone remodeling. In conditional (or           tissue-specific) knockout mice, CaSRs have been shown to play key roles in skeletal           development and in OB and osteocyte function by several groups. Such work supports the           idea that high extracellular [Ca] ([Ca]e), acting through CaSRs, is an ""anabolic           pathway"" in bone, akin to intermittent PTH (1-34) stimulation of PTH-R signaling in           bone. Several groups have found that direct CaSR activation in OC lineage cells reduced           their survival, gene expression, and resorptive function. This suggested that enhanced           OB and suppressed OC function might be accomplished through activation of CaSRs in           different bone cell populations.           Based on this work in mice and the known role of PTH peptides as bone anabolic agents in           humans, studies were done in mice to test the hypothesis that concurrent activation of           PTH-Rs and of CaSRs has synergistic effects on bone mass. Adult male mice given           intermittent subcutaneous (SC) injections of PTH(1-34) (40-80 ug/kg) and the           calcimimetic NPS-R568 (20 umole/kg) for 4-6 weeks showed dramatic synergistic anabolic           effects on bone mass and strength. PTH (1-34) injections alone significantly increased           trabecular (Tb) bone mass [Tb bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV)] by micro-CT in the           distal femur as well as Tb thickness (TbTh) (p<0.05). Co-injections of PTH (1-34) and           NPS-R568 produced significantly greater effects on Tb BV/TV and TbTh (by ~21%; p<0.01),           while NPS-R568 injections alone had no effect. These are large effects on bone mass, as           determined by highly sensitive methods - micro CT and bone histomorphometry. The latter           is the gold-standard for testing the effects of an intervention on dynamic bone           metabolic processes. This combination therapy also produced bone microarchitectural           changes (more plate-like trabeculi), compatible with mechanically stronger bone.           Cortical (Ct) bone is typically less affected by PTH (1-34) treatment. However, in these           experiments when Ct bone at the tibiofibular junction (TFJ) was assessed by micro-CT, it           was clear that combined injections of PTH (1-34) and NPS-R568 produced dramatic           increases in CtTV, CtBV, and CtTh of 8-10% (p<0.05). Thus, this work demonstrated clear           ""anabolic synergy"" of concomitant PTH-R and CaSR activation on both Tb and Ct bone in           adult male mice - findings potentially clinically significant and highly relevant to the           proposed trial. Similar and dose-dependent increases were seen in Tb bone of the L5           vertebrae [in BV/TV, TbTh, and Tb number (N); p<0.05 or p<0.01] and in their Ct bone at           the TFJ (CtTV, CtBV, and CtTh; p<0.05) in elderly female mice.           Dynamic histomorphometry on bone biopsy specimens in the mice supported these results.           Daily injections for 6 weeks of TPTD alone induced substantial bone formation by           fluorescent tetracycline labelling from Ct bone sections. Bone formation was           substantially augmented by co-administration of calcimimetic NPS R568. Quantitative           analyses of Tb and Ct bone parameters (N=12 mice/group) supported the micro-CT data,           indicating robustly strong increases in bone mass with this combination. By mechanical           testing of the mouse femurs, bone strength was tested, and the bones were found to be           stronger (greater energy to failure) in the male mice treated with combined PTH/NPS-R568           vs PTH (1-34)+vehicle.        3. Study Rationale Osteoporosis and fracture-related disability are important health           problems in older men. Fractures increase mortality. Men who fracture their hips have           twice the mortality of women sustaining those same hip fractures. Several drugs are           approved to treat osteoporosis in men [bisphosphonates, denosumab, and teriparatide           (TPTD) or PTH(1-34)], but there have been little insight as to how to use them most           effectively. TPTD has great appeal for treating osteoporosis in men because it           substantially improves bone mass, rebuilds the microarchitecture, improves bone           strength, and reduces fractures. Little is known about the best ways to employ TPTD in           the treatment of male osteoporosis. Should it be used only as monotherapy or does           concurrent or sequential use with other agents lead to the greatest benefit? The           proposed clinical trial is an effort to test a novel combination therapy for           osteoporosis in men based on exciting preclinical findings in mice. It is known that           TPTD achieves its anabolic effects by stimulating PTH-Rs in cells of the OB lineage.           Calcimimetics mimic the effects of high extracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca]e) by           activating CaSRs expressed in many cell types including OBs and OCs in bone.           A.Specific Aims and Hypotheses Tested To address the hypothesis that concurrent CaSR and           PTH-R activation produces synergistic anabolic effects on bone, a double-blind,           PBO-controlled trial in 48 men with low BMD testing a novel combination regimen will be           performed. Older male Veterans with low BMD by DXA will be randomized to 2 treatment           arms: TPTD+cinacalcet vs TPTD+PBO. Efficacy endpoints will be changes in BMD by DXA and           the bone turnover marker (BTM) P1NP (Aim 1). Pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of the           combination regimen vs monotherapy will be profiled (serum Ca, PTH) and safety confirmed           (Aim 2). A subset of 24 patients (12/treatment arm) will undergo detailed acute (8 hr)           PD assessments and clinical monitoring at the UCSF CRC (Clinical Research Center).           Safety will be assessed in all trial subjects with serum Ca and 24-hour urinary Ca           monitoring and with adverse event (AE) and clinical assessments. Although both drugs           used in this trial are FDA-approved (TPTD, 20 ug/day for osteoporosis; cinacalcet, 30           mg/day for HPT), an IND (Investigational New Drug) application is in place to give this           drug combination.           B.Study Aims and Hypotheses AIM 1: To determine the effects of treatment with           TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+PBO on BMD and bone metabolism in men with low bone           mass by assessing responses in lumbar spine (LS) BMD (primary endpoint) and femoral neck           (FN) BMD and levels of P1NP.           There are 2 hypotheses tested in this aim. Hypothesis 1a proposes that BMD responses to           combined TPTD+cinacalcet are greater than those induced by TPTD+PBO. LS BMD typically           responds quickly and robustly to TPTD and is the 1o endpoint of the trial. Changes in FN           BMD, a site often slower to respond and with smaller magnitude, are a 2o endpoint. DXA           measurements will be performed and analyzed as described below. Subjects will be treated           for 11 months (48 weeks). All subjects will receive Ca and vitamin D3 supplements           throughout the trial. Hypothesis 1b proposes that bone formation marker P1NP increases           to a greater extent with combined TPTD+cinacalcet vs TPTD+PBO. P1NP is the best           validated biomarker of TPTD action and responds rapidly and robustly to anabolic           therapy, the change in P1NP at 3 months (12 weeks) after initiation of treatment is a           key 2o endpoint for the study.           AIM 2: To determine the pharmacodynamic (PD) responses to study drug administration in           men with low bone mass by assessing acute and chronic changes in the serum [Ca] and           plasma intact PTH after drug administration and changes in urinary Ca excretion.           There are 2 hypotheses tested in the PD studies in this aim, which is focused on           establishing physiologic responses and confirming safety with this combination therapy.           Hypothesis 2a proposes that the serum [Ca] does not fall to >5% below the lower limits           of the normal range in response to the administration of study drugs. After           randomization, subjects will initiate dosing with the 2 study drugs. First, baseline           sampling (pre-study drug) will be done, and then subjects will have blood collected for           serum [Ca], albumin, and PTH at specific time-points in the 8 hours after study drugs           are administered. As is clear from the literature on PTH actions in vivo, TPTD tends to           raise serum [Ca], while cinacalcet is expected to lower intact PTH and thereby serum           [Ca] usually transiently. It is anticipated that the effects of these 2 drugs, known to           act over similar time-courses in humans, will tend to offset each other, so that the           serum [Ca] remains stable and within the normal range in subjects taking the combination           (TPTD+cinacalcet). In general, the majority of patients taking TPTD and the majority of           those receiving cinacalcet should experience offset of drug effects well before 24 hours           have elapsed post-dosing. Based on these kinetics, it is not expected that combined           treatment will produce major steady-state changes in serum [Ca]. At the very least, it           is expected that any serum [Ca] lowering will be modest (and transient), and           steady-state levels will not drop >5% below the lower limit of the normal range. This           will be carefully assessed, both acutely in the PD study [in 24 subjects (12/treatment           arm)] and chronically by examining pre-dose serum [Ca] over the full study (in all           subjects). Intact PTH will be monitored as an exploratory endpoint, since serum PTH           levels may fall with chronic cinacalcet treatment. Determining changes in endogenous PTH           secretion may be important for fully understanding the PD of concurrent TPTD+cinacalcet           therapy.           Hypothesis 2b proposes that urinary Ca excretion does not exceed 350 mg/24 hours in           subjects receiving study drugs. This parameter will be carefully studied throughout the           trial for these reasons. First, TPTD may raise urinary Ca because of increased gut Ca           absorption [due to increased 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D] and enhanced Ca mobilization from bone           (direct PTH action). Both effects increase the filtered load of Ca, which can raise           urinary Ca. Second, calcimimetics, by stimulating renal CaSRs may also raise urinary Ca           levels. Hypothesis 2b is predicated on the observation that men treated with TPTD alone           did not excrete >350 mg Ca/24 hours according to prior clinical trial data. In addition,           prior studies in patients with 1o HPT did not show significant hypercalciuria due to           cinacalcet. However, data on urinary Ca in normal subjects taking calcimimetics are           scant. If chronic hypercalciuria results from the combination therapy, there is           potential for consequences (renal stones, possibly renal insufficiency) that will be key           to know about. Thus, urinary Ca assessments throughout the study are critical safety           endpoints.           C.Primary and Secondary Objectives As primary objective, the study will examine the           effects on LS BMD by DXA of treatment with the combination of TPTD (PTH 1-34) + placebo           vs TPTD + oral calcimimetic cinacalcet in men with low bone mass or osteoporosis.           The study has two secondary objectives: (1) assess the effects of combination of TPTD           (PTH 1-34) + placebo vs TPTD + oral calcimimetic cinacalcet on FN BMD by DXA in men with           low bone mass or osteoporosis; and (2) assess the effects of the combination of TPTD           (PTH 1-34) + PBO vs TPTD + oral calcimimetic cinacalcet on the bone formation marker           serum P1NP in men with low bone mass or osteoporosis.           A safety assessment will include determining (a) acute and chronic changes in the           concentrations of serum Ca ([Ca]) and plasma intact PTH after administration of study           medications in both treatment arms in an 8 hour PD study; and (b) changes in 24 hour           urinary Ca excretion (over full 11 month trial) with both treatment regimens.        4. Study Design and Protocol      A.Subjects There will be 48 men randomized to one of two treatment arms: TPTD + PBO tablet      (N=24) or TPTD + cinacalcet tablet (N=24). Men of all ethnic and racial groups will be      encouraged to participate. The DXA scan done at screening will be used to determine whether      or not a man meets BMD criteria for enrollment into the study.      B.Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for Subjects - described elsewhere in the application      C.Study Drugs and Supplements Teriparatide (TPTD) or PTH 1-34 which will be obtained from      commercial sources and given at 20 mcg daily, by SC injection. Cinacalcet or sensipar, an      oral calcimimetic, will be given at the dose 30 mg daily orally.      The PBO control will be a purchased ""placebo"" tablet that will be packaged in exactly the      same manner as cinacalcet. Supplements in the form of Ca citrate tablets (200 or 500 mg      tablets) will be given in both treatment arms to subjects along with vitamin D3 (1,000      International Units) by mouth daily. Ca supplements will be adjusted along with an assessment      of dietary Ca intake to reach a total of ~1,000 mg elemental Ca per day.      D.Study Measurements Several types of measurements will be made in the course of the trial.        1. BMD will be measured at the LS, hip and radius by DXA at the UCSF CTSI CRC. Trabecular           bone score (TBS) will also be determined from the data collected during the DXA           assessment of the lumbar spine using commercially available software applications           available at the investigators' center.        2. Biochemical markers of bone turnover (BTMs) and vitamin D metabolites will be measured           during the study visits including the following: serum P1NP, serum C-telopeptide (CTX),           bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), RANK-L, and 1,25 (OH)2           vitamin D.        3. Dietary Ca intake will be assessed by the Block Food Frequency Questionnaire.        4. There will be PD testing during the study. This will include assessing acute changes in           the serum levels of Ca, albumin, phosphate and PTH during the acute administration of           the study drugs during an 8-hour PD test in the clinic at the Randomization Visit of the           study; determining chronic changes in the serum levels of calcium and PTH during the           entire study with the administration of the study drug combinations (11 months of the           trial); studying chronic changes in the urinary calcium at study visits during the full           trial.        5. In exploratory studies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be collected by           blood sampling of participants and those samples fractionated for cells of the OB and OC           lineage to determine whether the two treatment interventions alter the levels and           properties (gene expression markers) of the circulating populations of these cells.           E.Study Duration and Study Visits Subjects will be on study for approximately 12-13           months. Screening will be conducted at 2 separate visits. This will be followed by a           run-in period of 4 weeks for eligible subjects. The intervention period will be 11           months (48 weeks) in duration.           Screening will be done through a telephone call to initiate contact, describe the study,           and set up a visit to achieve informed consent and to do the screening DXA scan. There           are two Screening Visits, the first will involve obtaining the DXA scan, and the second           will involve lab testing, a complete medical history and physical exam to be performed.           The run-in period during which the participant takes only calcium and vitamin D           supplements for 4 weeks will follow.           The Randomization Visit will involve lab testing and in 12/24 subjects in each arm, an           8-hour PD Study. Subjects will be randomized to one of the study treatment arms and           taught to take the daily injections and the study medication tablets (cinacalcet vs PBO)           At week 1, subjects will have lab testing done and a telephone visit. Thereafter, at           Weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 36, and 48 there will be lab testing of blood and urine,           assessment of adverse events, and clinical followup done. At the final visit (Week 48,           approximately 11 months), a followup DXA scan will be done.

The intention-to-treat      (ITT) approach will be used, with all randomized men included in the analysis. Complete      follow-up data will be collected on every randomized subject, regardless of adherence. 2o      per-protocol analyses will be done, limited to those who remained on medication and those      with complete data. All statistical testing will be performed at nominal 0.05 level without      adjustments for multiple comparisons.      Analysis of Primary Endpoint      To determine the effects of 11 months of treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+PBO      on LS BMD (primary endpoint) Testing the 1o hypothesis for the effect of the 2 treatment arms      on the % change in LS BMD will use a t-test with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. The      extent of missing data will be reported in all statistical analyses. Overall missing data      rates are expected to be low since the investigators will make every attempt to obtain BMDs      at 11 months for all men, regardless of medication use. 1o analyses will be unadjusted. Using      standard statistical methods and means and SDs from published TPTD studies, the effect size      (true difference in means between treatment groups) that can be detected based on a t-test      comparison between treatment groups of the change in LS BMD with a fixed sample size of      24/group was calculated. Even if 20% of the subjects were lost to follow-up and did not      contribute 11-month LS BMD data, with a sample size of 40 the study is powered to detect a      between-group difference as small as 4.0%. A difference between treatment regimens of ~4%      (e.g., mean LS BMD increase in TPTD+PBO of 5% vs 9% increase in the combination group) would      be an effect size for BMD in the range that would be clinically promising and support      pursuing further studies of this combination therapy for osteoporosis.      Analysis of Secondary Endpoints      To determine the effects of 11 months of treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+PBO      on FN BMD and levels of the bone formation marker P1NP (secondary endpoints).      A similar approach will be taken for FN BMD and for the logarithm of the P1NP change as will      be taken for the primary endpoint above. On an exploratory basis, changes in TBS from      baseline to study end will be analyzed as BMD is. All hypotheses will be tested at the      nominal 0.05 2-sided significance level, with no formal adjustment for multiple comparisons.      In the analysis of 2o outcomes and in other 2o analyses, it is recognized that this might      increase type 1 error rates, due to multiple testing. To alleviate that concern, 1o and 2o      endpoints will be clearly distinguished, as well as exploratory analyses. Consistency among      multiple endpoints will be looked and caution will be exercise in interpreting marginally      significant findings, particularly unexpected results not motivated by a priori hypotheses.      The extent of missing data will be reported in all statistical analyses. Overall missing data      rates are expected to be low since every attempt will be made to obtain BMDs at 11 months and      P1NP at 3 months for all men, regardless of medication use. 1o analyses will be unadjusted.      This study has 80% power (with an alpha=0.05) to detect a between-group difference in change      in FN BMD as small as 3.5%. Since effects of TPTD on FN BMD in short-term studies are small,      it is recognized that +3.5% may be an ambitious difference between treatments for hip BMD.      However, the point estimates may give an indication of whether the combination has superior      effects on BMD at the hip and help investigators to plan future studies of this combination.      The distribution of P1NP change is non-Gaussian in multiple studies, requiring log      transformation (log ratio) and back-transformation for presentation. Using data from the PaTH      (Parathyroid Hormone and Alendronate for Osteoporosis ) trial of the 3-month change in P1NP,      the back-transformed mean change (95% CI) was +148% (117%, 183%). Based on the SD of the log      ratio in PaTH, a sample size of 40 (20/group, assuming 20% non-completers) will provide 80%      power with alpha=0.05 to detect a difference of +137% (e.g., an increase from 148% to 285%)      between P1NP responses of men treated with TPTD+cinacalcet vs TPTD+PBO.

Randomized
Parallel Assignment
The study design is that of a randomized double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled trial of the combination of teriparatide (TPTD) + the calcimimetic cinacalcet compared to monotherapy with TPTD alone in men with low bone mineral density (BMD).

",Effects of treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+PBO on lumbar spine BMD in men with low bone mass48 weeksHypothesis 1a proposes that BMD responses to combined TPTD+cinacalcet are greater than those induced by TPTD+PBO. LS BMD typically responds quickly and robustly to TPTD and is the 1o endpoint of the trial. DXA measurements will be performed and analyzed by standard protocols at baseline and at the end of the trial. Subjects will be treated for 11 months (48 weeks). All subjects will receive Ca and vitamin D3 supplements throughout the trial. The percentage change in LS BMD from baseline to 48 week/11 months of treatment will be the variable/endpoint that is calculated.,"
Effects of treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+PBO on serum P1NP in men with low bone mass
48 weeks
Hypothesis 1b proposes that serum P1NP (N-terminal pro-peptide of type 1 collagen), a highly sensitive marker of bone turnover and specifically of bone formation, will increase to a greater extent in men treated with TPTD+cinacalcet vs TPTD+PBO. Serum P1NP is the best validated biomarker of TPTD action and responds rapidly and robustly to anabolic therapy. This secondary endpoint will be assessed at the 3 month/12 week visit in the fasting state on morning lab tests (prior to study drug administration). The endpoint is a blood test of bone formation marker comparing results from Day 1/Randomization Visit to Study Visit at 3 months/12 weeks. The percentage change in this bone formation marker will be the variable that will constitute this secondary endpoint.

Effects of treatment with TPTD+cinacalcet compared to TPTD+PBO on femoral neck BMD in men with low bone mass
48 weeks
Hypothesis 1a also proposes femoral neck BMD responses to combined TPTD+cinacalcet are greater than those induced by TPTD+PBO. FN BMD responses tend to be smaller than LS BMD responses to TPTD and this aim will test whether the combination therapy (CaSR activation + PTH-R activation) will produce larger BMD responses at the FN site in men with low BMD. The percentage change in FN BMD from baseline to 48 week/11 months of treatment will be the variable/endpoint that is calculated.

","      This is a Phase 1/2, Open-label, Multi-center, Clinical Trial to evaluate the safety,      tolerability, and efficacy of Xeno-Skin® to provide temporary wound closure of severe and      extensive deep-partial or full-thickness burn wounds until definitive wound closure can be      achieved via permanent autografting.      Approximately 15 total subjects will be enrolled. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria and      provide written informed consent will receive Xeno-Skin® placement at a single burn wound      site. The designated Xeno-Skin® product size will be placed on the burn wound following wound      site preparation, including necessary debridement and tangential excision as determined by      burn surgeon and secured in place via suturing or stapling. The remaining burn wound will be      covered with human cadaver allograft and treated according to local standard of care with      care to avoid any overlap or significant contact of the two temporary wound dressings. The      Investigator will assess the wounds and identify the matched pair of burn sites then the      treatments will be randomly assigned to the sites.      Xeno-Skin® will remain in place until intentional removal per Investigator's direction      consistent with subject's overall clinical course, or if it is deemed to no longer provide      effective wound closure and barrier function to the wound bed. The Investigator will follow      local standard of care relevant to wound care and dressing changes while the Xeno- Skin® is      in place. Standard of care burn management will be provided by the Investigator.      Routine vital sign assessments, photography, laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and      urinalysis), physical exams, and adverse event monitoring will occur while Xeno-Skin® is in      place and for up to 1 year following initial placement. Subjects will be monitored via a      passive and active screening program using blood samples collected at time points throughout      the study period, as adapted from FDA Guidance for Industry.      The risk of transmission of infectious disease is expected to be extremely low and while      limited human trial data are available there have been no reports of transmission of porcine      microorganisms to humans, and to date, there have been no adverse events (AEs) related to the      use of Xeno-Skin® observed or reported, and independent analysis of PERV data and medical      records by the Safety Review Committee has indicated no evidence of zoonotic transmission in      this trial.    ","      Product Name: Xeno-Skin®      Chemical Name: alpha-1,3-galactosyltransferase knock-out (GalT-KO) porcine (Sus scrofa)      split-thickness skin      Chemical Structure: Xeno-Skin® is a live biotherapeutic, split-thickness, xenotransplantation      skin product derived from specialized, genetically engineered (alpha 1,3      galactosyltransferase knockout [GalT-KO]), Designated Pathogen Free (DPF), porcine donors      containing live (i.e. non-terminally sterilized) porcine cells, including endothelial cells      of intact vasculature and those comprising the dermal and epidermal tissue layers.      Proposed Indication: Xeno-Skin® is indicated for the treatment of a serious condition and      unmet medical need: severe and extensive deep-partial and full-thickness burn wounds      requiring hospitalization, surgical excision, and skin grafting.      Drug Type: Xeno-Skin® is classified as a Live Biotherapeutic Product (LBP). (Guidance to      Industry, Early Clinical Trials with Live Biotherapeutic Products, Section 1.b.) Active      Ingredient: Live (i.e. non-terminally sterilized) porcine cells, including endothelial cells      of intact vasculature, and those comprising the dermal and epidermal tissue layers      Product Structure: Xeno-Skin® has an approximate thickness of 0.022 inches (0.55mm) and is      currently provided in one investigational size: approximately 5x15 cm2 (22.5g/75 cm2).      Formulation: Each lot or releasable batch of Xeno-Skin® is derived from a single source      animal and each batch is independently processed and tested for various adventitious agents,      histology, morphology, sterility, and purity.      Route of Administration: Surgical engraftment, via sutures or staples Dosing Regimen:      Surgical engraftment, via sutures or staples, to provide temporary wound closure of severe      and extensive deep-partial and full-thickness burn wounds requiring hospitalization, surgical      excision, and skin grafting. The amount is of temporary wound dressing is based on the depth      and size (TBSA) of the burn injury.      Drug's Mechanism of Action: Patients with severe burns are at high risk of mortality due to a      devastating sequela of complications such as increased capillary leak and release of      inflammatory cytokines, infection from opportunistic pathogens, immune-compromise,      hypovolemia, hypothermia, electrolyte and pH imbalances, and other detrimental deviations to      pre-injury homeostasis as a result of a disruption in the skin barrier that contributes to      organ failure and often death.      Xeno-Skin® provides a temporary barrier against infection, helps prevent fluid loss, and      helps restore the functional skin barrier prior to definitive wound closure with the      placement of an autograft. Xeno-Skin®'s inclusion of viable epithelial, epidermal, and dermal      porcine cells permits revascularization of the wound bed, critical for efficient      re-epithelialization and wound healing.      This mechanism of action closely mirrors today's clinical standard, human cadaver allograft.      The same progression of wound healing processes occurs in both human cadaver allograft and      Xeno-Skin®. This mechanism of action distinguishes Xeno-Skin® from traditional xenografts      products on the market today, which are terminally sterilized, rendering the cells inactive,      limiting their therapeutic capability.      Drug Packaging: Each Xeno-Skin® product is individually packaged in a clear plastic,      externally threaded, 10-ml polypropylene vial with threaded seal-cap, stored on a rolled,      sterile nylon mesh backing on the dermal-side of the Xeno-Skin® product that serves to      support and protect the graft during processing and transport. Within this container, each      Xeno-Skin® product is individually immersed in 7-ml of sterile cryoprotective medium with 5%      dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (CryoStor CS5, BioLifeSolutions). Source animal serum is NOT      included or used in this process. The contents are cryopreserved via controlled rate, phase      freezer and stored at -80o C until use. All packaging materials are removed prior to the      surgical procedure and dressing placement.    ",,"

","      This is a 52 week, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.      After patients maintain a stable dose of Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) for at least 1 month,      they will be randomized to treatment with either Belimumab & Rituximab or placebo.Patients in      both groups will be on background MMF for the entirety of the study. Belimumab will be      administered subcutaneously and Rituximab intravenously. Placebo injections and infusions      will be of normal saline. Randomization will be done in a 2:1 manner to favor the treatment      group. It is hypothesized that that Rituximab and Belimumab combination therapy with      Mycophenolate Mofetil background therapy will improve fibrosis in SSc skin when compared to      treatment with placebo and Mycophenolate Mofetil in a group of patients with early dcSSc.    ","      The specific objectives of this study are to:        1. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is safe and tolerable in the treatment of           patients with early diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc when compared to patients treated with           placebo/placebo/mmf, as assessed by comparison of adverse and serious adverse effects.           In this study stand of care will be protocolized as mycophenolate mofetil.        2. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is more effective than placebo/placebo/mmf, as           measured by change in CRISS, which is a composite outcome measure provisionally endorsed           by the ACR for scleroderma clinical trials.

Change in the MRSS at 6 and 12 months
6 months and 12 months
The MRSS is a validated physical examination method for estimating skin induration. It is correlated with biopsy measures of skin thickness and reflects prognosis and visceral involvement, especially in early disease2, 4. It is scored on a 0 (normal) to 3+ (severe induration) ordinal scales over 17 body areas, with a maximum score of 51 and is used to categorize severity of SSc. Minimally clinically significant difference in MRSS is 3-5 points (Amjadi et al., American College of Rheumatology; Aug 2009; 2493-2494) It has been extensively used as primary/ secondary outcome in RCT with Scleroderma. This will be collected at every study visit.

Changes in the Short Form-36 (SF-36) Health Survey
through study completion, an average of 1 year
The SF-36 was developed during the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) to measure generic health concepts relevant across age, disease, and treatment groups. It assesses physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, role limitations due to emotional problems, energy/fatigue, emotional well-being, social functioning, pain, general health, and health change. For each, the minimum score is 0% and the maximum score is 100%. The 0% score is the poorest and the 100% score is the best score. On Short Form-36 (SF-36) forms, individuals with SSc score significantly lower than healthy controls in domains of physical component score, mental component score, physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, and mental health (Iudici et al, 2013).

Change in the scleroderma health assessment questionnaire-disability index (sHAQ-DI)
through study completion, an average of 1 year
The SHAQ-DI is a disease-targeted, musculoskeletal-targeted measure intended for assessing functional ability in scleroderma. It is a self-administered 20-question instrument that assesses a patient's level of functional ability and includes questions that involve both upper and lower extremities. The SHAQ-DI score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 3 (severe disability). It has a 7 day recall period and has been extensively used in SSc65, 67. 5 visual analog scales are included in the scleroderma-HAQ assessing burden of digital ulcers, Raynaud's, gastrointestinal involvement, breathing, and overall disease 68.

Change in PROMIS-29
through study completion, an average of 1 year
The PROMIS network developed item (question) banks and short forms in more than 20 health domains as well as a set of global health items and 29-, 43-, and 57-item profile measures. To create a brief, practical-yet-inclusive short profile, a consensus-building process was used to identify 7 of these 20 domains to produce the PROMIS-29.

Change in gastrointestinal tract (GIT) in scleroderma score
through study completion, an average of 1 year
The UCLA SCTC GIT 2.0 is a standardized set of outcome measures developed through literature review, patient focus groups and cognitive debriefing among patients with a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, other common gastrointestinal disorders, SSc, and a census-based US general population control sample (Khanna et al, 2009). The scale consists of eight domains relating to gastroesophageal reflux (13 items), disrupted swallowing (7 items), diarrhea (5 items), bowel incontinence/soilage (4 items), nausea and vomiting (4 items), constipation (9 items), belly pain (6 items), and gas/bloat/flatulence (12 items). The scales correlated significantly with both generic and disease-targeted legacy instruments, and demonstrate evidence of reliability.
, 
Change in Scleroderma Skin Patient Reported Outcome (SSPRO)
through study completion, an average of 1 year
The SSPRO includes patient-reported answers to 18 questions about how scleroderma affects the skin and how those skin problems affect how the person feels and does things. Each question is followed by 7 boxes with numbers 0-6, spaced equidistant in between. The boxes are anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, ""Not at all"" (box labeled 0) and ""Very Much"" (box labeled 6). The subject selects a box labeled by an integer in response to the question. The recall period is 1 week. The sum of the numbers associated with the answers to each question is the score. A higher score indicates worse skin symptoms.

Change in Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS-28)
Baseline 1, 6 months and 12 months
The DAS28 (Disease Activity Score 28) is a system developed and validated by the EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) to measure the progress and improvement of Rheumatoid Arthritis. DAS28 values range from 2.0 to 10.0 while higher values mean a higher disease activity. A DAS 28 below the value of 2.6 is interpreted as Remission. A value between 2.6 and 3.2 corresponds to a low disease activity. A value between 3.2 and 5.1 corresponds to moderate disease activity. A value greater than 5.1 corresponds to greater disease activity. ""28"" describes the number of different joints being assessed.
, 
Change in joint count
Baseline 1, 6 months and 12 months
A joint count is the most specific clinical method to quantify abnormalities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The swollen joint count reflects the amount of inflamed synovial tissue and the tender joint count is associated more with the level of pain.
, 
Change in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI): Measures joint tenderness and swelling
Baseline 1, 6 months and 12 months
The Clinical Disease Activity Index is calculated by adding the swollen joint count, tender joint count, patient global assessment, and the evaluator global assessment. The total minimum score is 0 and the maximum score is 76. A value of 0-2.8 indicates remission; 2.9-10.0 is low activity; 10.1-22.0 is moderate activity; 22.1-76 is high activity.
, 
Change in Global Combined Response Index
Baseline 1 through month 15
The global rank composite score is an analytic tool that accounts for multiple disease manifestations simultaneously but does not measure disease activity or severity. It reflects how participants compare with one another on the basis of a hierarchy of ordered outcomes: death, event-free survival (survival without respiratory, renal, or cardiac failure), FVC, the score on the Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ-DI; range, 0 to 3, with higher scores indicating more disability), and the modified Rodnan skin score.

Drug
Belimumab
Belimumab decreases B-Cell survival and has been FDA approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, another rheumatic autoimmune disease. Belimumab is a recombinant, fully human monoclonal antibody; it binds to the soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) with high affinity and inhibits its biologic activity. The background above provides a robust rationale for the investigation of belimumab in the treatment of dcSSc.

Rituximab
Rituxan® (rituximab) is a genetically engineered IgG1 kappa chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody containing murine light- and heavy-chain variable region sequences and human constant region sequences. The antibody reacts specifically with the CD20 antigen found on the surface of malignant and normal B cells, and established B cell lines. Studies have shown that rituximab binds via its Fc domain to human complement and lyses lymphoid B cell lines by complement dependent cytotoxicity through the induction of apoptosis and via antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Rituximab is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat some types of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis.

","      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, efficacy and blood kinetics of      autologous T cells genetically modified to express anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor in      patients with relapsed or refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.    ","      Peripheral blood (up to 600 mL) will be collected from a subject after obtaining a written      informed consent and completing the 1st registration. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells      (PBMCs) and plasma are obtained from the blood, and T cells contained in the PBMCs are      transduced with anti-CD19 CAR gene by using SFG-1928z retroviral vector. Anti-CD19 CAR      expressing T cells (CD19-CAR-T) will be expanded using a medium containing autologous plasma.      After the T cells pass in quality control tests, the subject will go into 2nd registration.      Subjects will be hospitalized and administered Cyclophosphamide on Day -2 or Bendamustine on      Day -3 to Day -2 intravenously as Pre-treatment, and then subjects will receive 1st infusion      of CD19-CAR-T on Day 0 and Day 1 (Day 1：1/3 dose, Day 2：2/3 dose) as a split dose. In case      the sufficient cell number of CD19-CAR-T is manufactured, DLT is not observed after      CD19-CAR-T infusion, certain clinical effect is observed and additional treatment is      preferable, the necessity of 2nd infusion will be assessed. In the case that 2nd infusion is      necessary, it is allowed to infuse at appropriate timing.      This study is conducted based on the 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Three subjects are enrolled      in each group of Dose Level. If one of the 3 subjects show DLT during DLT assessment period,      another 3 subjects will be added; therefore, decision as to whether the next Dose Level can      follow or not is made based on the results obtained from the total of 6 subjects.      The investigator assesses the tumor shrinkage effect of CD19-CAR-T in accordance with      ""Revised response criteria malignant lymphoma"", at 12 week after the 1st infusion of      CD19-CAR-T (or at the time of termination). The investigator also assesses the safety during      the follow-up period. Long-term follow-up study is conducted at frequency of once a year for      15 years after the 1st infusion of CD19-CAR-T in reference to guidelines of FDA.    ",,"

","      This international, multi-centre, double-blind vaccine study is a three-arm prospective 1:1:1      randomisation comparing each of two experimental combination vaccine regimens i.e.      DNA/AIDSVAX (weeks 0,4,24,48) and DNA/CN54gp140 (weeks 0,4) + MVA/CN54gp140 (weeks 24,48)      with placebo control. There will be a concurrent open-label 1:1 randomisation to compare      daily TAF/FTC (week 0-26) to daily TDF/FTC (weeks 0-26) as pre-exposure prophylaxis.      The study aims to randomise up to 1668 eligible adults (18-40 years) through collaborating      clinical research centres in 4 countries (Mozambique; South Africa; Tanzania; and Uganda).      Each participant will be followed for a minimum of 74 weeks after enrolment.      The trial is designed to detect a reduction in HIV incidence that has public health relevance      sufficient to justify implementation of the combination vaccine regimen. In light of the high      level of effectiveness demonstrated in the PrEP trials (up to 86% reduction in HIV), this      trial is powered to detect a protective vaccine efficacy of 70% at the final analysis.      The PrEP component will determine whether the effectiveness of TAF/FTC is unacceptably lower      than the effectiveness of TDF/FTC.    ","      This international, multi-centre, double-blind vaccine study will be a three-arm prospective      1:1:1 randomisation comparing each of two experimental combination vaccine regimens with      placebo control.      Pre-screening for risk and HIV status will take place as part of a Registration Cohort which      will precede and continue in parallel to the PrEPVacc trial enrolments. This will give HIV      negative volunteers time to learn about the PrEPVacc trial and facilitate timely enrolment.      Clinical screening for the vaccine trial will take place during the 8 weeks prior to      randomisation from local communities in Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda where      the clinical research centres are located. Eligible participants who are HIV-uninfected      adults aged 18-40 years at high risk of HIV infection will be enrolled at week 0 and      randomised to one of three vaccine arms:        1. Vaccine group A: DNA-HIV-PT123 and AIDSVAX® B/E (weeks 0,4,24,48)        2. Vaccine group B: DNA-HIV-PT123 and CN54gp140 in MPLA-L (wks 0,4), then MVA-CMDR and           CN54gp140 in MPLA-L (wks 24,48)        3. Vaccine group C: Saline Placebo (wks 0,4,24,48)      There will be a concurrent open-label 1:1 randomisation to one of two PrEP regimens:        1. Control PrEP: Daily TDF/FTC (week 0-26)        2. Experimental PrEP: Daily TAF/FTC (week 0-26)      Participants will be randomised at each clinical centre through web randomisation after      entering the quantifiable eligibility criteria. Randomisation will be stratified by centre      and by gender for vaccines and for PrEP. Clinic staff and participants will be blind to      allocation of active or placebo vaccines, but the pharmacist preparing the vaccines will      know. As the volume of gp140 in MPLA-L is 0.4ml and given at the same timepoints as products      with a volume of 1ml, clinic staff will be able to identify participants allocated to the      CN54gp140 in MPLA-L or matched placebo.      Clinic staff and participants will know which PrEP agent each participant is allocated to.      Participants will continue to receive study PrEP through to week 26 after which access to      PrEP will revert to local supply of generic drug.      The target accrual is around 1668 HIV uninfected adults, but this is an endpoint driven      multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) trial design, and therefore the target may be adjusted      following a recommendation from the IDMC. In addition, participants who do not complete the      third immunisation will be replaced whilst this is feasible. Participants will be followed up      for a minimum of 74 weeks after enrolment.      The primary efficacy outcome measure for the vaccine analysis is HIV acquisition by a      participant who completed three immunisations and was HIV negative at week 26.      The primary efficacy outcome for the PrEP analysis is HIV acquisition at or before week 26 by      a participant who was HIV negative at enrolment.      The primary safety outcome for both analyses is a clinical decision to discontinue the      vaccine or PrEP regimen for an adverse event that is considered related to product.      This trial is designed to detect a reduction in HIV incidence that has public health      relevance sufficient to justify implementation of the combination vaccine regimen. In light      of the high level of effectiveness demonstrated in the PrEP trials (up to 86% reduction in      HIV), this trial is powered to detect a protective vaccine efficacy of 70% at the final      analysis.      The PrEP component of the trial aims to show the effectiveness of TAF/FTC is not unacceptably      lower than the effectiveness of TDF/FTC, assessed from the observed lower confidence limit      for the Averted Infections Ratio (AIR).      The Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review an interim analysis of vaccine efficacy      in order to determine whether each active vaccine arm has demonstrated sufficient efficacy to      warrant further investigation. This analysis will only consider new infections arising after      the week 26 visit and only those in individuals who have completed the first three      immunisations. The analysis will take place after approximately 7 of these infections have      occurred in the placebo group. The investigators will not be informed of the timing of the      interim analysis, unless there is a recommendation to modify the protocol.      The PrEP analysis will consider new infections up to the week 26 visit in individuals who      were HIV negative at enrolment.    ",,"

The vaccine component of PrEPVacc is placebo-controlled. Study staff, participants, laboratory staff and clinical staff assessing safety outcomes will not know who has been allocated vaccine or placebo, but pharmacy staff will know. The committee assessing the efficacy endpoints will not see the allocation in the first instance. The IDMC and statistical staff preparing the closed reports for the IDMC will also know the allocation.
Clinic staff will see the difference in volume between CN54gp140 in MPLA-L/matched placebo (0.4ml) and DNA-HIV-PT123/matched placebo (1ml) due to the position of the plunger, but they will not be able to differentiate between active and placebo.
The randomisation to control PrEP: experimental PrEP is 1:1 and all study staff and participants will know the allocation after randomisation as this is open-label.

This exclusion is included for two reasons.             First, there is evidence of decreased marrow reserve in HIV+ patients and antiviral             treatment is associated with myelosuppression. Thus, drug treatment designed to be             myelosuppressive may bemore toxic in this patient population. Second, extensive             laboratory culturing of the bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells is             required. No preclinical samples which are HIV+ have been evaluated with the gene             transfer modality proposed and thus the feasibility and safety of gene transfer and             selection in HIV+ samples cannot yet be advocated. Such studies are planned so as to             not preclude HIV+ patients in later studies.          -  Pregnant or lactating women. There is data to indicate that BCNU and TMZ is             teratogenic and carcinogenic.

","      This study is a prospective, single center phase II clinical trial in which patients with      Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) ) will receive a haploidentical transplantation. The purpose of      this study is to learn more about newer methods of transplanting blood forming cells donated      by a family member that is not fully matched to the patient. This includes studying the      effects of the chemotherapy, radiation, the transplanted cell product and additional white      blood cell (lymphocyte) infusions on the patient's body, disease and overall survival. The      primary objective is to assess the rate of engraftment at 30 days and overall survival (OS)      and event free survival (EFS) at 1 year post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).      Primary Objectives        -  To estimate the rate of engraftment at 30 days after TCR αβ+ T-cell-depleted graft           infusion in patients receiving a single dose of post graft infusion cyclophosphamide.        -  To estimate the overall survival and event free survival at 1-year post transplantation.      Secondary Objectives        -  To calculate the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD after HCT.        -  To calculate the rate of secondary graft rejection at 1-year post transplantation        -  To calculate the cumulative incidence of viral reactivation (CMV, EBV and adenovirus).        -  To describe the immune reconstitution after TCR αβ+ T-cell-depleted graft infusion at 1           month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year.      Exploratory Objectives        -  To longitudinally assess the phenotype and epigenetic profile of T-cells in SAA patients           receiving HCT for SAA.        -  To assess the phenotype and epigenetic profile of T-cells in DLI administered to SAA           patients post HCT.        -  To longitudinally assess CD8 T cell differentiation status in SAA patients using an           epigenetic atlas of human CD8 T cell differentiation.        -  To examine the effector functions and proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells isolated           from SAA patients before and after DLI.        -  Quantify donor derived Treg cells at different time points in patients received HCT.        -  Determine Treg activation status at different stages after HCT.        -  Are specific features of the DLI product associated with particular immune repertoire           profiles post-transplant?        -  How does the diversity and functional profile of the DLI product alter the response to           pathogens in the recipient?        -  Do baseline features of the recipient's innate and adaptive immune cells correlate with           post-transplant immune repertoires and response profiles?    ","      Immunosuppressant therapy (IST) is the main treatment for SAA for patients who do not have an      HLA-matched sibling donor available for transplant. But some patients with SAA do not respond      to IST and some others relapse after IST. HCT using an unrelated but HLA-matched donor is the      only curative option for these patients but many patients lack a suitable HLA-matched donor.      St Jude is trying to increase donor options for these patients by using novel therapeutic      strategies by combining two widely used of GVHD prophylaxis methods: i) selective T cell      depletion and ii) use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. This will allow expansion of the      donor pool to include haploidentical donors as well as reduce the risk of GVHD. The goal of      this protocol is to test whether combining these GVHD prophylaxis approaches will allow use      of haploidentical donors, reduce risk of GVHD, reduce transfusion dependence and improve      immune reconstitution.      For this study chemotherapy, antibodies and radiation will be given to prepare the body to      receive donor cells. Participants will then be given the donor cell infusion.      Patients will receive two types of donor blood cell products - a progenitor blood cell      infusion and then a donor lymphocyte infusion. Both the progenitor blood cell and the donor      lymphocyte infusion will be processed in a laboratory at St. Jude using a machine called the      CliniMACS™.      In this clinical trial, participants will receive a special type of progenitor blood cells      (called TCRαβ- depleted blood cells) from the donor.      After the donor progenitor cells have started to grow within the body (engraftment),      participants will receive a second product that contains mature immune cells. These immune      cells called CD45RA-depleted lymphocytes or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will help fight      infections in the body after the transplant and strengthen the developing immune system.

","      Patients less than or equal to 21 years old with high-risk hematologic malignancies who would      likely benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Patients with a      suitable HLA matched sibling or unrelated donor identified will be eligible for participation      ONLY if the donor is not available in the necessary time.      The purpose of the study is to learn more about the effects (good and bad) of transplanting      blood cells donated by a family member, and that have been modified in a laboratory to remove      the type of T cells known to cause graft-vs.-host disease, to children and young adults with      a high risk cancer that is in remission but is at high risk of relapse. This study will give      donor cells that have been TCRαβ-depleted. The TCR (T-cell receptor) is a molecule that is      found only on T cells. These T-cell receptors are made up of two proteins that are linked      together. About 95% of all T-cells have a TCR that is composed of an alpha protein linked to      a beta protein, and these will be removed. This leaves only the T cells that have a TCR made      up of a gamma protein linked to a delta protein. This donor cell infusion will be followed by      an additional infusion of donor memory cells (CD45RA-depleted) after donor cell engraftment.      This study will be testing the safety and effects of the chemotherapy and the donor blood      cell infusions on the transplant recipient's disease and overall survival.    ","      In this study, participants with high-risk hematologic malignancies undergoing hematopoietic      cell transplantation (HCT), who lack an available suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA)      matched related/sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD), will receive a      TCRαβ-depleted haploidentical donor HCT with additional memory cell DLI. One course of      blinatumomab will be empirically added for patients with CD19+ malignancy.      Primary Objectives        -  Determine the maximum effective dose for prophylactic CD45RA-depleted DLI when given in           the early post-engraftment period.        -  Assess the efficacy of TCRαβ-depleted progenitor cell graft with additional memory           T-cell DLI, plus selected use of blinatumomab, in haploidentical donor hematopoietic           cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies as measured by 1 year EFS (events =           relapse, death)      Secondary Objectives        -  Assess the safety and feasibility of the addition of blinatumomab in the early post-           engraftment period in patients with CD19+ malignancy        -  Estimate the incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, malignant           relapse,event-free survival per disease subgroups (e.g. ALL vs AML), and overall           survival at one-year post-transplantation.        -  Estimate incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).        -  Estimate the rate of transplant related mortality (TRM) in the first 100 days after           transplantation.        -  To measure and describe the pharmacokinetics of rabbit ATG in HCT recipients on this           study.      Exploratory Objectives        -  Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative           lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis, V-beta           spectratyping, and lymphocyte phenotype and function.        -  Describe the use of additional CD45RA-depleted DLI for recipients who have severe viral           infections, disease recurrence or progression, or poor immune reconstitution. Assess and           record efficacy of CD45RA-depleted DLI for these conditions, and all adverse events that           are related to CD45RA-depleted DLI.      Blinatumomab will be given to patients with a history of CD19+ malignancy as determined by      St. Jude hematopathologist review of current and historical specimens and reports.      Blinatumomab dosing will begin no sooner than 1 week after CD45RA-depleted DLI and no later      than Day +90. There must be no acute GVHD or it must be quiescent. ALT must be less than 5x      ULN, bili less than or equal to 1.5x ULN, and creatinine less than or equal to 1.5x ULN.      If more than one family member donor is suitable, then donor selection will be based on      several factors including: degree of KIR mismatching, donor-recipient matching of CMV      serology, donor-recipient red blood cell compatibility, degree of HLA matching, size of the      potential donor, previous use as a donor, presence of donor-specific antibody, and overall      health and availability of the potential donor.      A G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cell product (identified as HPC,A) is the      preferred progenitor cell graft source. Our desired target goal will be 5 x 10^6 CD34+      cells/kg. This number of cells will be necessary to provide an adequate graft, following the      various ex vivo manipulations, for prompt reconstitution. More than one collection may be      needed to achieve this goal. Donors will undergo a standard hematopoietic progenitor cell      mobilization regimen consisting of 5 days of GSF given subcutaneously at 10      micrograms/kilogram. The graft will be collected by leukapheresis on day 5 (and 6 if needed)      of G-CSF. The HPC product will typically be collected and infused fresh, however there may be      patients or logistical situations that require the HPC product to be collected early,      processed, and stored frozen.

","      Background:      Researchers are looking for new ways to control and eradicate malaria. They want to test      vaccines to block malaria transmission in adults in Mali. These vaccines work by inducing      antibodies in a person. The antibody is then taken up with blood by a mosquito that bites the      person. This blocks parasite development in the mosquito. This stops malaria transmission to      another person.      Objective:      To test the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity, and transmission-blocking activity of the      vaccines Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA with AS01 in Malian adults.      Eligibility:      Healthy Malians ages 18-50 living in certain areas in Mali who:      Are not pregnant or breastfeeding      Are not infected with HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C      Do not have evidence of immunodeficiency      Do not have history of severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis      Design:      Participants will be screened with:      Medical history      Physical exam      Malaria Comprehension Exam      Blood and urine tests      Electrocardiogram (for participants in certain study groups)      Participants will be randomly assigned to a study group.      Participants will be monitored for 12-16 months. For the first 7 months, they will have      between 1 and nine visits a month. The number depends on the month and on what group they are      in. For the rest of the months, they will have 1 monthly visit.      Each visit includes a physical exam. Most include blood tests.      Participants will get 3 doses of a study or comparator vaccine. They get the vaccine through      an injection in the upper arm. This occurs at their first visit, then 1 month later, and then      5 months later.      Participants will be followed for at least 6 months after the last vaccine.      If participants develop an injection site rash or reaction, photographs may be taken of the      site.    ","      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) would be a valuable tool for local      elimination or eradication of this disease, and may contain components that block      transmission to mosquitoes (such as Pfs25 or Pfs230) or that prevent human infection (such as      the vaccine RTS,S). Pfs25 and Pfs230, surface antigens of zygotes and ookinetes (and      gametocytes for Pfs230) in the mosquito stage of P. falciparum, are the lead candidates for a      malaria transmission blocking vaccine (TBV). Recombinant Pfs25M and recombinant Pfs230D1M      have each been conjugated to P. aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with AS01. Our      ongoing experience with Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA in Malian adult trial participants, and      the extensive experience with the AS01 adjuvants in African children and adults, justify      conducting the first-in-human trial of Pfs25M-EPA and Pfs230D1M-EPA with AS01 in Malian      adults. This dose-escalating phase 1 study will determine safety, immunogenicity, and      functional activity of these vaccines in Malian adults. Pfs25M-EPA + Pfs230D1M-EPA in AS01      will be assessed by mosquito feeding assays in Malian adults for evidence that they may      reduce the number of malaria transmission events in study subjects.      A total of 305 subjects will be enrolled at multiple sites in Mali, West Africa to receive      escalating doses of a malaria transmission blocking vaccine (s): Pfs25M-EPA/AS01,      Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01, or simultaneous administration of Pfs25M-EPA/AS01 and Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01;      or a comparator vaccine (ENERGIX-B). Enrollment within each group will be staggered for      additional safety and subjects will only be enrolled into the co-administration group once      each individual dose has been administered. Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months      after the last vaccination. Safety outcomes will be local and systemic adverse events and      serious adverse events. Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by      ELISA against recombinant Pfs25, Pfs230, EPA, CSP, and B cell and T cell responses.      Functional activity of the induced antibodies will be assessed in TBV arms by standard      membrane feeding assays conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious      Diseases, and activity that interrupts malaria transmission will be measured in all arms by      direct skin feeding assays in Mali.      Subjects in the open label safety cohorts (Arms 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b) will be      offered reenrollment for follow-up laboratory assessment to explore the duration of      immunogenicity and functional activity at approximately 9, 12 months post vaccination.      Following scheduled, intentional unblinding, subjects enrolled in Arms 2c, 2d, and 4c will be      provided the opportunity to re-enroll for a fourth vaccination (Arm 2c and 2d with 40      microgram dose of Pfs230D1M-EPA/AS01; Arm 4c with Menatctra) approximately 1 year post      vaccination #3. Subjects in these arms will also be eligible to re-enroll for follow up of      duration of immunogenicity and functional activity at approximately 9, 12 months post      vaccination if they choose not to enroll to recive the booster vaccination. Subjects will be      followed similarly to the previous year for safety, immunogenicity, and functional activity.    ",,"

",      The main objective of this randomized trial is to compare disease-free survival (DFS) in high      risk leukemia patients who underwent haploidentical HCT followed by an add back strategy of      HSV-Tk donor lymphocytes or standard haploidentical HCT    ,"      Delayed immune-reconstitution remains one of the main limitation of haploidentical stem cell      transplantation. The risk of severe infections remains high for several months and CD3+      reconstitution could take more than 10 months. The low number of lymphocytes infused with the      graft, the degree of HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) disparity, and a reduced thymic function      in adults and differences in host/donor antigen presenting cells are contributing causes.      The infusions of HSV-TK engineered lymphocytes may represent a significant therapeutic      improvement in haploidentical HCT (hematopoietic cell transplantation), because it remarkably      may enhance both GvL (Graft versus Leukemia) activity, thus reducing the occurrence of      disease relapse, and post-transplant immune reconstitution in the absence of chronic immune      suppression, thus decreasing the rate of both post-transplant opportunistic infections and      transplant-related mortality. Furthermore, the efficient control of GvHD achieved via the      suicide mechanism allows also the multiple infusion of HSV-TK-treated donor lymphocytes, when      needed, that might further improve post-transplant host immune reconstitution, and survival      in patients receiving haplo-HCT. Finally, this therapeutic approach can become a valuable      option for all candidates, including patients with advanced disease and older age.      The proposed clinical trial represents an innovative therapeutic treatment for patients      affected by high risk acute leukemia, who have undergone haploidentical stem cell      transplantation.
