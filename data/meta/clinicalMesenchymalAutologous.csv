","      Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a demyelinating and degenerative disorder of the central      nervous system affecting vision and brain and spinal cord function which leads to      accumulating disability with a 5 year-mortality of approximately 30%. Survivors are typically      left with severe morbidity secondary to blindness, quadriparesis and respiratory failure. No      agent has been found to be highly effective in halting disease activity.Based on recent      outcomes of Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in autoimmune diseases including multiple      sclerosis, and based on the mechanisms of neuromyelitis optica, the investigators anticipate      that mesenchymal stem cells transplantation may provide lasting disease stability for      neuromyelitis optica patients.    ","      Primary objective was to assess feasibility and safety; the investigators compared adverse      events from up to 3months before treatment until up to 12 months after the infusion.      As a secondary objective, the investigators chose efficacy outcomes to assess the Expanded      Disability Status (EDSS)、annual relapse rate (ARR) and time to next relapse after transplant.      Third objective anterior visual pathway and pyramidal tract as a model of wider disease.      Masked endpoint analyses was used for electrophysiological and selected imaging outcomes.    ",,"

Pathogenesis isn't exactly clear, treatment is relatively palliative and results are usually      suboptimal. 30-40% of the patients have autoimmune origin. Patients are forced to use      immunosuppressive treatments which have systemic effects. Some of the treatments have effects      as severe as the disease itself.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most common used cells in clinical trials. These cells      can provide efficient immunosuppression in severe conditions like immunosuppressive resistant      Graft versus Host Disease.

The study population will consist of      10 patients who had spinal cord injury for at least 12 months, with cervical chronic and      complete spinal cord injury, ASIA grade A.      A practitioner, a surgeon and a nurse will review the medical records of the patients to      determine the presence / absence of inclusion / exclusion criteria. If the patient is a      potential candidate for the study, an interview will be scheduled to review and confirm      his/her eligibility.      Patients will undergo a series of clinical and neurological assessments and will also be      submitted to the following procedures:        -  Cell blood count;        -  Biochemical analysis (measurement of electrolytes - sodium, potassium, magnesium);        -  Renal function tests (urea and creatinine);        -  Liver function tests;        -  Coagulation profile;        -  Metabolic profile (glucose, total cholesterol and fractions);        -  Urine summary and culture;        -  Serology required for blood transfusion and marrow transplant in Brazil;        -  Electrocardiogram;        -  Chest X-Ray;        -  Bone densitometry;        -  Urodynamic studies;        -  Somatosensory evoked potential;        -  Computed tomography of thoracic and lumbar spine;        -  Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine.      Also as part of the preoperative evaluation, the patients will respond to questions from the      SF (Short Form) -36 questionnaire (for assessment of quality of life) and the questionnaires      for the assessment of neuropathic pain.      Clinical follow-up will be kept for patients who suspend their participation in the study for      any adverse event and / or laboratory abnormality, or for the patient's own desire, following      insurance protocols. In addition to the clinical and surgical follow-up, specific medical      care will be offered to patients who experience adverse events, until stabilization of the      patient, even if the target date for completion of the study has been exceeded.      The candidates included in the study will be asked to voluntarily participate and give their      informed written consent.    ",,"

The study      population will consist of 40 patients who had spinal cord injury for at least 12 months,      with thoracolumbar chronic and complete spinal cord injury, ASIA grade A.      A practitioner, a surgeon and a nurse will review the medical records of the patients to      determine the presence / absence of inclusion / exclusion criteria. If the patient is a      potential candidate for the study, an interview will be scheduled to review and confirm      his/her eligibility. Patients will undergo a series of clinical and neurological assessments      and will also be submitted to the following procedures:        -  Cell blood count;        -  Biochemical analysis (measurement of electrolytes - sodium, potassium, magnesium);        -  Renal function tests (urea and creatinine);        -  Liver function tests;        -  Coagulation profile;        -  Metabolic profile (glucose, total cholesterol and fractions);        -  Urine summary and culture;        -  Serology required for blood transfusion and marrow transplant in Brazil;        -  Electrocardiogram;        -  Chest X-Ray;        -  Bone densitometry;        -  Urodynamic studies;        -  Somatosensory evoked potential;        -  Computed tomography of thoracic and lumbar spine;        -  Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic and lumbar spine.      Also as part of the preoperative evaluation, the patients will respond to questions from the      SF (Short Form) -36 questionnaire (for assessment of quality of life) and the questionnaires      for the assessment of neuropathic pain. Clinical follow-up will be kept for patients who      suspend their participation in the study for any adverse event and / or laboratory      abnormality, or for the patient's own desire, following insurance protocols. In addition to      the clinical and surgical follow-up, specific medical care will be offered to patients who      experience adverse events, until stabilization of the patient, even if the target date for      completion of the study has been exceeded. The candidates included in the study will be asked      to voluntarily participate and give their informed written consent.    ",,"

","      A double-blind, randomized, cross-over phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and the      efficacy of the intravenous administration of autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) to      patients with active multiple sclerosis (MS) resistant to currently available therapies.    ","      The mechanism of action of MSC relies on their ability to modulate pathogenic immune      responses and provide neuroprotection through the release of anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidant and      trophic factors as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies.      Patients will be randomized to receive immediate vs. delayed treatment with either a dose      equal to 1-2 millions/kg of body weight of autologous MSC, or equivalent volume of suspension      media at baseline. At 6 months treatments will be reversed.      The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate        -  treatment's safety within one year from MSC administration by measuring the the number,           time-frame and severity of adverse event and        -  treatment's activity in terms of reduction in the total number of contrast-gadolinium           enhancing lesions (GEL) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

","      • The goal of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous MSC      application for the therapy of drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy. Adult (18-60 years old)      patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from refractory epilepsy with frequent (>5 events per      month) seizures were included in this study. The pts were randomized to the standard      treatment with anti-epileptic drugs (control group, 30 pts) or anti-epileptic drugs plus      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (study group, 30 pts). The pts in the study group      received one intravenous injection of ex vivo expanded MSCs (40-101 x 106 cells) and one      subsequent endolumbal injection of neuroinduced MSCs (2.7 - 8.0 x 106 cells). Both the      unfavorable reactions to MSC infusions and the clinical effects, including complications,      were examined. The unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or      hemorrhage at the site of injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system      (CNS; i.e., hyperthermia, fatigue, and myalgia).The possible beneficial effects of therapy in      the two groups of pts were examined based on clinical observations and electroencephalography      measurements (prior and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy). To      determine potential changes in disease progression, the signs of cognitive impairment,      behavioral disorders, and particularly, changes in seizure character and frequency were      evaluated using the National Hospital Scale of Seizure Severity. The main points of disease      monitoring were ""yes"" or ""no"" responses (to therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and      remission of disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were performed to evaluate      electrical alpha, beta, theta and delta waves based on standard and additional criteria. The      paroxismality index, the peak frequency of EEG activity, the index of slow activity, and the      summarized points of EEG pathology signs were calculated for each patient. All assessments      were performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were      compared to identify the potential differences between the two pts groups. Therapy was      terminated when immediate unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections were observed. The      final observation of each patient included clinical and EEG assessments at the time point of      12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy.    ","      The main goal of this phase 1 clinical trial was to evaluate the safety of an autologous      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) application as therapy for drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy in      a one-center study. It is well known that drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy is a      dramatically invalidating disorder for which applied stationary and outpatient therapies have      no real clinical effect. Therefore new approaches are needed to reach remission, to stop      disease progression, and to increase patient quality of life. For this study, adult (18-60      years old) patients (pts) of both sexes suffering from drug-resistant symptomatic epilepsy      with frequent (>5 events per month) seizures were included into study. Drug-resistance was      defined by a lack of any evident clinical response (i.e., no decrease in seizure frequency or      reduction in disease progression) of the pts with symptomatic epilepsy to carbamazepine,      valproic acid, topiramate, lamotrigine, or phenobarbital (i.e., anti-epileptic drugs[AEDs])      as monotherapies and in different combinations over the previous one calendar year. The      criteria for exclusion were patient refusal to participate, unfavorable reactions to therapy,      CNS inflammatory conditions, chronic psychoses, CNS tumors, relapses of chronic somatic or      neurologic diseases, and blood positivity for hepatitis B or C or HIV. The plan included the      inclusion of 30 pts in the study group and 30 pts in the control group over a period of 5      years. The pts were randomized to standard treatment with AEDs (control group) or AEDs plus      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs, study group). The MSCs were obtained from bone      marrow samples of the same patient and were purified and expanded ex vivo in a specialized      cellular biotechnology laboratory. The MSCs were characterized by immunophenotyping as      CD90+CD105 +CD45-CD34-cells. After 3 weeks of cultivation in vitro, a portion of the MSC were      additionally cultured for 7 days in Neurocult-XF proliferation medium to obtain neuroinduced      MSCs. Neuroinduction was proved by the presence of the genetic markers nestin and      neuron-specific enolase. Finally, 40-101 x 106 autologous cultured MSCs and 2.7 - 8.0 x 106      autologous neuroinduced MSCs were harvested, resuspended in saline solution containing 5%      autologous blood serum for injection, and, following a measurement of the viability (98%      cells), transferred to the clinical center.      The pts in the study group received one slowly delivered (over 5-10 minutes) intravenous      injection of ex vivo expanded autologous MSCs in a volume of 20 ml, and 5-7 days later, each      patient in the study group received an additional slowly delivered endolumbal injection of      the neuroinduced MSCs in a volume of 5 ml. Both unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections      (over one day following the performance of the procedures) and the early (up to one month)      and late (up to 6 months) clinical effects, including complications, were evaluated.      Unfavorable reactions to the MSC injections included local pain or hemorrhage at the site of      injection and systemic reactions of the central nervous system (CNS, i.e., hyperthermia,      fatigue, and myalgia). Later potential unfavorable systemic reactions of the CNS and vascular      system, including infectious and noninfectious complications of the progression of the      disease to be controlled, were examined. All of the events were documented in medical cards.      In cases in which these events exhibited dangerous characteristics, they were declared to      members of the monitoring board (the center's ethical committee) for the evaluation of the      exclusion of the patients from the study or the termination of the clinical study.      Also evaluated were the possible beneficial effects of MSC-based therapy in the pts of the      study group. These effects were detected via clinical observations at selected therapy time      points (i.e., 3 and 12 months after the application of the MSC-based therapy) and      electroencephalography measurements prior to and one year after the therapy. To determine the      possible changes in disease progression, signs of cognitive impairment, behavioral disorders,      and changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated. For the evaluation of      cognitive impairment, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination. The handicapping effect of      disease on daily life was scoring using the Subjective Handicap of Epilepsy Scale. State      anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital anxiety and depression scale .      Changes in seizure characteristics and frequency were evaluated using the National Hospital      Scale of Seizure Severity. The processes of voluntary attention and performance were studied      with Schulte tables according to the methods of Kraepelin. Schulte tables were used to study      sensorimotor reaction times and the distribution and stability of attention. The ""Account of      Kraepelin"" method was used to study health, fatigue and the stability of attention. The      assessment of short-term memory was performed via the method of memorizing 10 words; this      method aims to determine the volume and speed of oral-aural memory.      Main clinical characteristics that are used for disease monitoring were ""yes"" or ""no""      responses (regarding therapy), seizure frequency (per month), and remission of disease at the      early (3 months) and late (12 month and more) time points after therapy. To evaluate partial      responses to therapy, the numbers of pts who exhibited 50% reductions in seizure frequency      were assessed. Seizure type (i.e., generalized tonic-clonic, partial complex, simple partial,      and multiple types of seizures) was also evaluated along with changes in seizure type during      the treatment course.      Electroencephalography recordings were performed at admission and across the monitoring      period using a Mizar EEG 201 encephalography system with biopotential registration from 16      body points according to the ""10-20"" scheme. The observed electrical alpha, beta, theta and      delta waves were analyzed in 3-min segments (with further recalculation for each 1-minute      segment) prior to (at admission) and 1 year after MSC application. The peak frequency of the      alpha waves was also calculated. Both the spontaneous state and the state after the loading      probe (hyperventilation and photostimulation) were evaluated for each patient. The      characteristics of the electroencephalographies (EEG) were attributed to local and diffuse      cortical alterations. We evaluated the paroxysmality index, quantities of local and      generalized spikes of epileptiform waves per minute, peak frequency of EEG activity, index of      slow activity, and summarized points of EEG pathology signs. EEGs with epileptiform activity      included spikes, spike-slow waves, and high-amplitude spikes. The EEG recordings were      performed based on standard and additionally proposed criteria . All of the assessments were      performed for the pts in the control and study groups, and the obtained data were compared to      determine the potential differences due to the additionally performed MSC-based therapy. A      patient's therapy was terminated at any time point if immediate unfavorable reactions to the      MSC injections were observed. The final observations of the patients included clinical and      EEG assessments at 12 months (or more) after the application of the MSC-based therapy. The      summarized data for the pts in the control and study groups were collected in an electronic      database for further analysis and interpretations.    ",,"

",      Recovery of erectile function using bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) after in vitro      expansion under restricted culturing conditions.    ,"      Four diabetic male patients ranging from 25-65 years diagnosed with erectile dysfunction will      be selected. This diagnosis is based on medical history, validated questionnaires, physical      examinations, laboratory tests and specific diagnostic tests. Patients with any evidence of      untreated hypogonadism, current urinary tract or bladder infection, clinically evident penile      anatomical deformities, previous penile implant or penile vascular surgery, uncontrolled      hypertension or hypotension, reported unstable Cardiovascular diseases, uncontrolled diabetes      (HbA1c > 10%), or primary hyperlipidemia will be excluded. The investigators hypothesize that      the intracavernous injection of stem cells will facilitate the recovery of erectile function      resulting in satisfying clinical outcomes in patients.      This study was performed:        1. To test the safety of autologous intracavernous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.        2. To evaluate benefit for the patient concerning recovery of natural erection by           performing detailed and specific diagnostic tests prior and post MSCs injection by a           team from Jordan University Hospital and Cell Therapy Center in Jordan University.        3.

","      Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that      selectively affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to bulbar,      respiratory, and limb weakness. There is no effective treatment, and the disease usually      progresses to death within 2 to 4 years. The therapeutic plasticity of mesenchymal stem cells      (MSCs) may be an attractive therapy to this complex disease, turning MSCs strong candidates      for cellular therapy in ALS.      Design-A phase 1 open-safety clinical trial. 4 patients will be selected according to a      restricted inclusion and exclusion criteria and after 2 escalated infusions of MSCs, there      will be a follow up period of one year Methods - Primary endpoint: safety of mesenchymal      autologous stem cells infusions escalated in two intrathecal administrations in patients with      ALS defined as severe adverse events (SAe). Secondary endpoints: clinical response,      laboratorial and magnetic resonance imaging of patients submitted to cellular escalating      doses applied in the study. Quality of life, according to El Escorial criteria, ALSFR scale      and functional scales.      Conclusion: This study is a primary step before a large randomized double-blind clinical      trial for ALS. It is expected to confirm the safety of escalated MSCs therapy in ALS      patients, initial data of efficacy in addition to improved quality of life.    ",,,"

","      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that leads to permanent functional and      neurological deficits in injured individuals. The limited ability of the Central Nervous      System (CNS) to spontaneously regenerate impairs axonal regeneration and functional recovery      of the spinal cord. The leading causes are motor-vehicle crashes, sports-associated      accidents, falls, and violence-related injuries.      Unfortunately, there is still no effective clinical treatment for SCI. In recent years,      tissue engineering and regenerative medicine based approaches have been proposed as      alternatives for SCI repair/regeneration. Mesnchymal stem cells (MSC) use in SCI showed      promising results in several studies. Our aim is to assess and compare the safety and      effectiveness of autologous BM-MSC vs autologous AT-MSC in these patients.    ","      The study will be conducted at Cell Therapy Center (CTC) in Jordan, where 14 SCI patients      meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited and blindly divided into 2 groups of equal      numbers. The first groups will be treated with autologous BM-MSC, while the second group will      be treated with autologous AT-MSC. The outcomes and improvements will be assessed using the      American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS).

","      This study is looking at a new treatment, using the patient's own stem cells (the repair      cells of the body), to see whether this can help reduce pain and promote healing of the      Achilles tendon, without side effects.    ","      Tendon disorders compromise pain free activity and often progress to chronic pain with a      major impact on quality of life. More than 85,000 patients each year see their general      practitioner (GP) with Achilles Tendinopathy (AT) which affects the lower leg in young and      middle aged adults. The main treatment is physiotherapy, although surgery is eventually      considered in 25-45%of patients, an intervention that requires several months of      immobilisation and has unpredictable outcomes.      Other treatments include, shockwave therapy, Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) (a blood injection of      platelet rich plasma) and steroid injections, but other than physiotherapy non have been      shown to be better than placebo. There is a need for improved nonsurgical treatments. There      is an established treatment in horses that involves injection of the horses own stem cells      into the tendon, which has been shown to be effective but has never been used in man. We wish      to translate the technology to humans and propose a pilot phase II trial to establish the      safety of stem cells implanted in diseased human tendon. We aim to study 10 patients with      chronic mid substance achilles tendinopathy to assess safety as our primary outcome measure.      In addition we capture clinical outcomes scores and ultrasound appearances. Other than the      stem cell injection, all assessments will be non invasive. Participants will be otherwise      healthy adults, aged 18-70 and recruited from routine outpatient clinics at the Royal      National Orthopaedic Hospital, presenting with a painful heel, diagnosed by a specialist as      Achilles tendinopathy, and having already undergone a minimum of 6 months of physiotherapy.      Each participant will have 6 months follow up. This study will help inform a larger clinical      trial in the future for which a further ethics application will be made.    ",,"

",      1. Objectives: Evaluation of mesenchymal stem cell therapy effects on cellular and humoral           immune responses in refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.        2. Design: This study has been performed as a phase 1 clinical trial.        3. Setting and conduct: Autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells were obtained           by bone marrow aspiration and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium-Alpha (MEM-alpha) for           4 weeks in standard clean room and then transfused to RA patients intravenously.        4. Participant's major eligibility criteria is as follows: Ten refractory rheumatoid           arthritis patients who show resistance to non biological Disease-modifying antirheumatic           drugs (DMARDs) after 6 to 12 months have been enrolled in this study.        5. Intervention: A single dose of intravenous autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal           stem cells have been administered into patients with resistance to non-biological           DMARDs.        6. Main outcome measures (variables): Finding of mesenchymal stem cell therapy effects on           the cellular and humoral immune responses and evaluation of the effect of chemokines in           homing of immune cells following the intervention.    ,"      Refractory rheumatoid arthritis patients who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been      selected. After signing informed consent form, autologous stem cells were obtained by bone      marrow aspiration. Isolation and culture (3 to 4 weeks in MEM-alpha medium) of mesenchymal      stem cells (MSCs) were performed in accredited good manufacturing practices (GMP) clean room.      A panel of cluster of differentiation (CD) markers including CD105, CD166, CD44, CD45, CD90,      and CD34 were checked for making sure about differentiation of cells into MSCs after 3-4      weeks of cell culture. Viability of MSCs was checked by Trypan blue testing and all of the      cultivations were negative for bacterial contamination. A single dose of 1000000 to 2000000      mesenchymal stem cells/kg infused into patients intravenously. To prevent anaphylactic      reactions, a single intravenous dose of hydrocortison (100 ml) and oral dimenhydrinate (10      ml) were administered before MSCs infusion into patients. The effects of mesenchymal stem      cells on the cellular and humoral immune responses and also the role of chemokines in homing      of immune cells were studied at time points 1, 6 and 12 months after intravenous      administration of MSCs in refractory rheumatoid arthritis.

",      The purpose of this study is evaluating the safety of endobronchial transplantation of      autologous mesenchymal stem cells derived bone marrow in patients with emphysema.    ,"      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide epidemic disease that the global      prevalence of it was estimated to be approximately 210 million individuals and accounting for      more than three million deaths annually. And currently, it is the fifth chief cause of death      in the United State of America. COPD is characterized by chronic, irreversible inflammation      of the airways and has two pathologic features, emphysema and bronchiolitis.      The most relevant feature in the lung emphysema is airflow limitation, resulting from the      loss of alveolar wall and enlargement of alveolar space distal to the terminal bronchiole.      Cigarette and air pollution are the most major factors for developing COPD. Unfortunately,      aside from supplemental domiciliary oxygen for the small number of patients who demonstrate      resting arterial hypoxemia and smoking cessation for continued smokers, there are no      interventions that have been unequivocally shown to prolong survival in patients with COPD.      In the preprocessing phase, patients will underwent a complete evaluation of the pulmonary      function test with spirometer to measure the FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC, cardiac evaluation      (clinical examination, six minute walk test, echocardiography TTE(transthoracic      echocardiography ), and electrocardiography),chest X-ray, chest computed tomography scan      (helical/high resolution),o2 saturation by oximeter, as well as routine laboratory tests      (blood gas, urinalysis, coagulation, complete blood count (CBC), blood urea nitrogen, fasting      glucose, creatinine, AST(aspartate aminotransferase), ALT(alanine aminotransferase),      C-reactive protein, serology for hepatitis B and C, antihuman immunodeficiency virus, and      treponemal test for syphilis (FTA-ABS)). The Dyspnea Scale Score test, modified according to      the British MMRC, was also conducted, according to Mahler and Wells and Curley.And quality of      life measures will assess according to SF-36(Medical Outcomes Study 36-Items Short-Form      Health Survey) questioner.      Patients will taken to the operating room, placed in a prone position, and administer a      spinal anesthesia. Approximately, 120 mL of bone marrow will aspirated from each puncture and      after preparation about 60 million autologous MSCs will transplant by bronchoscopy into the      endobronchial of these patients.

","      Although, effective immunotherapies for MS exist which downregulate the anti-myelin      reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of the disease, there is no effective means today      to stop the progression of disability and induce remyelination. Neuronal stem cells were      shown to possess the ability to restore neuronal activity and produce new neurons through      transdifferentiation. Various other types of stem cells were tested in animal models with      promising results, revealing a potential for restoration of the neurological function in      neuroimmune and neurodegenerative conditions. Adult bone marrow derived stromal cells (MSC)      were shown to induce similar (to neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and neuroregenerative      effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the animal model of      chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). MSCs offer practical advantages for      clinical therapeutic applications, since they can be obtained from the adult bone marrow and      therefore the patient can be the donor for himself, without any danger for rejection of the      cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer profile and are less prone to malignant      transformation.      Our initial clinical experience with 10 patients with ALS and 10 with multiple sclerosis show      that intravenous and intrathecal administration of MSCs is feasible and safe.      In this study we propose an explorative protocol with the injection of MSCs (both      intrathecally and intravenously) in patients with MS, in an effort to prevent further      neurodegeneration through neuroprotective mechanisms and induce neuroregeneration and      restoration of neuronal function.      The primary endpoint will be to further evaluate the safety and feasibility of the treatment      with MSC infusions, in MS patients. Additionally, the migration ability of the transplanted      cells will be evaluated by tagging MSCs with the superparamagnetic iron oxide particle      (Feridex) for detection by MRI. Clinically the patients will be followed by monthly      evaluations of the MS functional rating scale (EDSS) scale. The MRI, will be also used to      evaluate changes in the total volume of lesions in the brain and the degree of atrophy.      Significance: This project may provide information for possible therapeutic uses of this type      of bone marrow adult stem cells in MS but may also serve as a pilot platform and pave the      path for future applications of various types of stem cells in neurodegerative diseases, in      general.    ","      This study, is designed as a phase 1/2 open-safety clinical trial. At its first phase, 15      consenting patients with MS are included.      Inclusion Criteria:      Consenting patients fulfilled the following 4 inclusion criteria for this study:        1. the clinical criteria of Poser et alfor definite MS;        2. men and nonpregnant women aged 25 to 65 years;        3. duration of disease longer than 5 years; and        4. failure to respond to the currently available and registered agents for MS (ie,           interferons, glatiramer acetate [Copaxone], and immuno-suppressors), as manifested by an           increase of at least 1 degree in the EDSS score during the past year or the appearance           of at least 2 major MS relapses during the same period.      Exclusion criteria:        1. patients who were treated with cytotoxic medications (ie, cyclophosphamide,           mitoxantrone, and azathioprine) during the 3 months before the trial;        2. patients with significant cardiac, renal, or hepatic failure or any other disease that           may interfere with the ability to interpret the results of the study;        3. patients with an active infection; and        4. patients who showed severe cognitive decline or were unable to understand and sign the           informed consent.      Bone marrow aspiration is performed under short general anesthesia with puncture from the      posterior superior iliac crest while the patient was lying in a left or a right lateral      position. Approximately 200 mL of bone marrow inocula are obtained from each patient.      MSC Preparation and Culture A culture of purified MSCs is prepared under aseptic conditions      (positively pressurized clean rooms) using filtered sterilized Dulbecco modified Eagle medium      with low glucose lev- els (Qiagen, Valencia, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine      serum, 1% L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin- nystatin solution (all from Biological      Industries, Kibbutz Beit- Haemek, Israel).      Mesenchymal cells are cultured for 40 to 60 days, until they reach confluency, and then      harvested and cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide-containing medium in liquid nitrogen      (-196°C). At 2 weeks, a sample is taken for sterility testing and quality control. After      sterility confirmed, the MSCs are transferred to the laboratory on dry ice, thawed in a 37°C      water bath, and washed twice with normal saline solution to remove any residual dimethyl      sulfoxide. The cells are then resuspended in normal saline at a concentration of 10x106/mL to      15x106/mL. Two-thirds of the total number of cells (usually 60x106 to 100x106) are injected      intrathecally, and one-third, intravenously. A sample of the cells to be injected is tested      by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis; cells (98%) should express the surface      markers characteristic of MSCs (CD29, CD73, CD90, CD105, and CD166) and be negative for CD34,      CD45, and CD14.      Treatment Protocol All patients receive an intrathecal injection via a standard lumbar      puncture (mean of 1 million cells per Kg of body weight) and an intravenous injection of      0.3-1 million cells per kg, intravenously..      An extension phase is scheduled for patients completing the first phase of this trial as an      open prospective study with repeated intrathecal or intravenous injections of autologous MSC      in patients from the initial trial and 10 additional ones (total up to 24 patients) with      progressive forms of MS (secondary progressive, primary progressive or      relapsing-progressive). Patients should be defined as failures to first and second lines of      immunomodulatory treatments experiencing deterioration (at least 0.5 degree in the EDSS      scale) during the year preceding their inclusion to our study or had at least one major      relapse without sufficient recovery. Patients will be treated with 1x10 million MSC per kg of      body weight, intrathecally and intravenously and subsequently with up to 8 courses of IT- or      IV-injections of MSC (at the same dose), at intervals of 6-12 months. The duration of the      trial is 4 years.      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for the whole duration of the trial, for safety      assessment and changes in the disability scores (EDSS).      Immunological analysis will be performed at 4 time points (day 1, month 1, month 3 and month      6) following the first MSC-treatment and will include a fluorescent cell sorter (FACS)      analysis to evaluate the proportions of the lymphocytes expressing markers of immune      activation or of regulatory cell phenotype.

","      Many patients with osteoarthritis of the knee fail non-operative measures and elect to have      knee arthroplasty to improve their quality of life. If successful, intra-articular      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) injections into the knee may offer another viable non-operative      treatment modality. Additionally, this modality may have reparative or regenerative      potential, which could lead to the first treatment for osteoarthritis that treats the      underlying disease as opposed to symptomatic control.      Additionally, there are no acceptable non-surgical treatments for focal chondral defects of      the knee. Surgical treatments that do exist have diminished outcomes if performed on patients      older than age 30-40 years. If successful, intra-articular MSC injections into the knee would      represent the first non-operative treatment for focal chondral defects and also represent a      potential option for treatment in patients over the age of 30-40 years.      This trial will be a prospective, single-center phase I pilot study to evaluate the safety      and tolerability of a single intra-articular injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs      in 16 subjects, 8 who have knee osteoarthritis and 8 who have a focal chondral defect in the      knee. Patients will undergo a bone marrow harvest procedure at the Dahms Clinical Research      Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. MSCs will be isolated and      expanded. After approximately 2-3 weeks, patients will return for an intra-articular      injection of 50x106 MSCs Subsequent study visits will occur on post-injection day 7 and      months 2, 6, 12, and 24. Safety of intra-articular injection of MSCs will be evaluated at      study visits by interval history, physical examination and assessment of any adverse events      that are observed/reported. Additionally, efficacy will be evaluated by having patients      complete functional outcome measures including: Visual Analog Score (VAS) for pain, Knee      Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee      (IKDC) Subjective Knee Form, and Lysholm Knee Scale. These will be completed at the      pre-treatment visit and then repeated at the 2, 6, 12, and 24-month follow-up visits. Lastly,      T1 rho and T2 mapping on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to assess for improved      cartilage quality after intra-articular injection of MSCs. An MRI will be obtained at the      pre-treatment visit. At the 12 and 24 month follow up visit, additional MRIs will be obtained      and analyzed to compare the pre-treatment MRI to post-treatment MRIs.    ",,,"

Treatment
Single (Participant)
","Primary Endpoint: Incidence of treatment emergent major adverse events directly related to MSC injection24 monthsEstablish the safety and tolerability of expended autologous intraarticular MSC injections into the knee by the incidence of no major adverse events (AE) determined to be directly related to MSC injection by the end of the 24 month follow up period. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence during the clinical investigation in a patient administered stem cells that does not have a causal relationship with the treatment that occurs from the time of consent through the last clinic visit at 24 months post-injection. An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the administration of the investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product. AEs will be described by duration (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to investigational product, or if unrelated, the cause.","
Secondary Endpoint: Development of Pain following injection based on Visual Analog Scale scoring.
2, 6, 12 and 24 months
Pain will be analyzed based on visual analog pain scores (VAS) by clinically and statistically significant amounts by six-month follow up and maintain these improvements throughout the two-year study period. Data analysis will be performed separately on the knee osteoarthritis subgroup and on the focal chondral defect subgroup. This will consist of a comparison of mean values for VAS scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months. Clinically significant outcomes will be determined based on the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) occurring for each respective scale, which is defined as the smallest change score needed for the effect to be considered clinically relevant; described below. Specifically, VAS represents a patient-reported measurement tool used to quantify perceived level of pain, graded on a scale from 0 to 10 with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worse pain possible.
, 
Secondary Endpoint: Clinical Evaluation of Injection based on functional outcomes scoring using KOOS, IKDC and Lysholm scoring scales.
2, 6, 12 and 24 months
Functional outcomes will be evaluated clinically and statistically throughout the study period. Data analysis will be performed on the knee osteoarthritis and the focal chondral defect subgroups. Mean values for Knee Injury and Osteoathritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (IKDC), and Lysholm scoring scales pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 2, 6, 12, and 24-months will be compared. KOOS is a qualitative assessment of knee pain, stiffness, function, and quality of life within the last week. The IKDC is a quantitative assessment of knee symptoms with daily and sporting activities with a high score of 100 representing no limitations or pain, with lower scores signifying pain or limitations in knee function. The Lysholm score rates knee pain and symptoms with a high score of 100, with scores > 90 representing excellent function and scores <65 representing poor function.
, 
Secondary Endpoint: Reparative potential of intra-articular MSCs based on improvement in cartilage quality using MRI.
12 and 24 months
T1 rho and T2 mapping observed from MRIs at 1-year and 2-year follow-up to determine the reparative potential of intra-articular MSCs. T1 rho values increase as degenerative changes worsen; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, it is expected that T1 rho values would increase. T2 mapping values primarily reflect changes in water content and collagen anisotropy. Focal areas of increased T2 mapping values correlate with focal areas of cartilage damage; therefore, as cartilage quality improves, T2 mapping values would decrease. Clinically significant changes will be observed by comparing T1 rho and T2 values in areas of relatively preserved hyaline cartilage within our patients with the areas of degenerative change to utilize an internal control. Data analysis will consist of a comparison of mean values for quantitative T1 rho and T2 mapping data pre-operatively and at follow-up visits at 12 and 24-months.

",      This is a clinical trial for non-diabetic chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients undergoing total      pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT). Participants will be randomized to      either bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or control with the standard of      care. Participants will be followed for one-year post-transplant.    ,"      This will be a randomized, controlled clinical trial for CP patients scheduled to undergo a      TP-IAT surgery. Those who are consented will be randomized into one of three groups. One      group will receive islet transplantation alone, a placebo. The other two groups will receive      islets plus autologous bone marrow-MSCs at two different doses (20x10^6/patient, or      50x10^6/patient). The TP-IAT procedure will remain as routinely performed. Patients will be      followed for12 months post-transplantation, having 3 follow-up visits scheduled on days 90,      180, and 365 after the transplant. The primary endpoint will be a change in islet function      from baseline to 12 months post-transplantation as measured by the C-peptide area under the      curve following a mixed meal tolerance test. Potential effects of MSCs on glycemic control,      pain relief, quality of life, and adverse events will be evaluated at each follow-up visit.    ",,"

","      This study evaluates the effect of cryopreserved autologous adult bone-marrow mesenchymal      stromal cells (BM-MSC) in patients with active multiple sclerosis, compared to placebo.      Patients will be allocated to one of the 2 treatment arms (BM-MSC or placebo)and at month 6,      the treatment will be crossed to receive the other product. The objective is to assess the      safety of a single infusion BM-MSC, and to explore its efficacy in these patients.      Patients will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years.    ","      To date, there is no effective therapy to cure multiple sclerosis (MS). Immunomodulatory      therapies are useful in reducing the frequency of inflammatory processes (relapses) but don't      delay significantly the progression of the disease, prevent long term disability or induce      the repair of damaged tissue. This proposal contemplates the use of adult autologous bone      marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSC) as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat      patients with active MS. This is a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical trial in      which 8 patients with active forms of MS and moderate disability will enter the trial with      the primary objective of assessing the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous      infusion of BM-MSC. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy by gadolinium enhancing      lesions though magnetic resonance imaging, neurophysiological effects and immunological      effects. Once randomized, patients will undergo BM extraction and once confirmed the      availability of the needed dose, they will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment arms      (BM-MSC named XCEL-MC-ALPHA, or placebo). XCEL-MC-ALPHA will be cryopreserved for all      patients regardless the allocated arm. At month 6, the treatment will be crossed. Patients      will be evaluated at month 12 and will be followed-up for a total of 3 years.    ",,"

","      Stem cells (SC) are the foundation cells for every organ, tissue and cell in the body. They      are undifferentiated ""blank"" cells that do not yet have a specific function. Under proper      conditions, they begin to develop into specialized tissue and organs. They are      self-sustaining and can replicate themselves for long periods of time.

These      two groups collaborate in the present project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the      Hospital Universitario del Río Hortega, who leads the clinical trial and deals with the      medical aspects. The proposed trial is based on positive results obtained in previous animal      studies performed by the present multidisciplinary team. A phase I / II clinical trial with      10 patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region is proposed. Autologous      mesenchymal stem cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous      plasma matrix and cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery      and the cavity filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Follow up      tests will be conducted at 3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by      panoramic radiography and computerized tomography scan.    ","      The proposed test is based on previous animal experiments with positive results by the      multidisciplinary team applicant, whose results are presented in paragraph 2.6 (group results      Valladolid) and Annex I (group results Oviedo).      The investigators propose phase I-II trial with 10 patients with a common condition and      difficult to solve volumetric regeneration therapies, such as bone cysts in the maxillofacial      region.      Autologous mesenchymal cells isolated from a sample obtained from the cancellous bone of the      tuberosity intraoral mandibular later and after expansion, will be conveyed in the matrix of      autologous serum. The total process takes 6-8 weeks. After this time, perform the osteotomy      and enucleation of the cyst under local anesthesia and the residual cavity is filled with      bioimplant containing the MSV-H.      Once the bioimplant, there will be clinical controls at 2 weeks, 2 and 6 months, to follow      the evolution of regeneration by bone cavity in panoramic radiograph and CT scan.      This project proposes a novel approach to therapy twice, combining a tissue engineering      protocol (bioimplant) consisting of autologous mesenchymal cells have already been approved      by the unit cell production of Valladolid (MSV-H), and a new protein matrix obtained      autologous serum crosslinked in order to stimulate the regenerative capacity of maxillary      cystic bone defects.

","      The conventional treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) includes physical therapy and      rehabilitation and in some cases may require surgical intervention. Although improved      emergency care and aggressive treatment can help in preventing further damage and even      restore minimal sensory functions, still a large proportion of patients suffer with prolonged      disabilities. It led neurologists to search out for new treatment options for this otherwise      debilitating disorder. Recent advances in research have developed a better understanding of      stem cell biology especially their role in tissue repair and regeneration. Encouraging      results in pre-clinical phase and limited human trials have proved that stem cells can be      safely and effectively delivered to the injured site for regeneration of damaged tissue.      Although a variety of cell types have been tried for their role in repair of spinal cord      injury, majority of clinical trials employed stem cells taken from bone marrow especially      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). Bone marrow MSCs are a good choice for regenerative      therapies owing to advantages like ease of collection and ex-vivo culturing, immune tolerance      and their ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types including neuronal lineage      cells. Intravenous application or direct injection of MSCs into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) via      lumber puncture in animal models of SCI and brain trauma had shown that MSCs can migrate      towards and integrate into injured spinal tissue and reduce cyst size and increase functional      recovery. The literature indicates that acute, sub-acute and chronic injury can be a      therapeutic target for MSC grafting. The mechanism of action may however vary among these      conditions. In acute phase, MSC administration play anti-inflammatory role, while in      sub-acute/chronic setting it may be used as neurostimulator and for cell bridging effect and      possibly glial or neuronal cell replacement. The investigators propose a non-randomized,      single group, open label, phase-I, interventional study to evaluate the safety and efficacy      of intrathecal delivery of patient's own (autologous) bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells for      treatment of spinal cord injury. This will include determination of functional recovery      (neuro-muscular control and sensation) in the affected area and overall improvement in      quality of life of the patients and also take into account any side effects, if observed.    ","      The role of regenerative therapies has gained more importance due to increased number of SCI      in the wake of recent anti-terrorism operations by the armed forces and non-availability of      any curative treatment for this category of patients. The promising results of preliminary      clinical trials have proved that adult stem cells especially multipotent mesenchymal stromal      cells can be safely injected and well tolerated and have shown functional improvement in SCI      patients. The successful treatment in these patients will not only improve functional status      of these otherwise debilitating patients, but can also reduce the burden on health care      facilities. Mesenchymal stem cells have been shown to promote anatomical and functional      recovery in animal models of SCI by promoting tissue sparing, axonal regeneration, and      remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs are primarily due to the secretion of soluble      factors and the provision of extracellular matrix that provide protection and support repair.      MSC are attractive candidates for transplantation into human patients because they can be      easily harvested, expanded and banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for      autologous transplantation, obviating the need for immune suppression. In this study patients      suffering from sub-acute and chronic phase of spinal cord injury shall be included. Patients      will undergo detailed screening through MRI and motor and sensory assessment by ASIA score.      Further evaluation will include electromyography (EMG) and tests for      electroneurophysiological assessment like nerve conduction velocity (NCV) will also be done.      Bone marrow aspiration will be done from iliac crest of the patients, followed by mononuclear      cells (MNCs) separation by density gradient centrifugation. MNCs will be washed and cultured      in tissue culture flasks. After 48 hours non-adherent cells will be removed from culture.      Medium will be changed twice weekly till MSCs reach 70-80 % confluence. At that point MSCs      will be harvested and after microbiological and other quality control testing the cellular      preparation will be diluted to final concentration and infused by intrathecal injection.      Primary outcome measure is safety which will be determined by clinical evaluation by two      independent neurologists during one month of hospital stay after receiving treatment course.      Secondary outcome measures will include American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment      scale and NCV/EMG.    ",,"

","      The present study is being undertaken as a phase I study to determine the safety and      feasibility of using adipose derived mesenchymal stem cell preparations (MSC) for treatment      of CM. Intravenous and locally targeted stem cell treatment have already been reported in the      context of treating various chronic pain conditions with early evidence of efficacy and a      good safety profile. The treatment of CM is based on the model for treatment with botulinum      where superficial facial and cranial injections are utilized. In addition, stem cells can be      given intravenously as well.    ","      Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling complex neurological disorder recognized as a      complication of migraine in the the International Classification of Headache Disorders.      Patients with CM experience headache on 15 days per month. CM is associated with significant      disability and reduced health-related quality of life. Approximately 1.3% to 2.4% of the      general population suffers from CM, and one in five CM sufferers cannot work because this      condition impacts their ability to lead productive lives. CM is frequently complicated by      overuse of acute pain medications. Some drugs have regulatory approval for migraine      prophylaxis; none are approved specifically for CM prophylaxis although recently, botulinum      injection has been FDA approved for CM treatment with marginal treatment effects with many      patients failing to have complete remission. The present study is being undertaken as a phase      I study to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose derived mesenchymal stem      cell preparations (MSC) for treatment of CM.

",      The main objective of the study is to evaluate feasibility and tolerance of the intravenous      injection of autologous mesenchymal stem cells for patients presenting an ischemic stroke      (less than 6 weeks).    ,"      Stroke is the leading cause of acquired adult disability. Except the hospitalization in      stroke units, only thrombolysis has been shown to be efficient to treat acute ischemic stroke      in the first three hours after the onset. Increasing brain plasticity after stroke represents      an important alternative strategy. Cell therapy provides a functional improvement after      cerebral ischemia in rodent models. This ""restorative"" therapy aims to replace destroyed      cerebral tissue with a stem cells graft. Despite these encouraging experiments, we do not      know yet the best way of administration of the stem cells, the best dose and the optimal      delay of the graft. The pioneer clinical studies failed to reproduce this benefit for      patients probably because of the limited number of studied patients. Therefore, more      translational studies are needed to improve our knowledge in this promising field. Among      different cell sources, mesenchymal (or stromal) stem cells (MSC) derived from bone marrow      offer the advantage of arising from a non tumoral and no modified source and are not sources      of immunological or ethical problems.      Our research project involves a development of cell therapy in a phase IIa clinical trial of      feasibility and safety in patients (randomised, controlled, open, with 3 parallel groups).    ",,"

","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are stromal cells that have the ability to self-renew and also      exhibit multilineage differentiation. MSCs can be isolated from a variety of tissues, such as      umbilical cord, bone marrow, and adipose tissue. The multipotent properties of MSCs make them      a promising option for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA).

","      Diabetes is a major concern in public health because of its high frequency and its negative      consequences. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is present, regardless of age, in 50 to 75% of men      with diabetes. It is related to endothelial dysfunction and a decrease in smooth muscle and      nerve cells. In type 1 diabetic patients, ED is part of the chronic complications of      microangiopathy. Current therapies are exclusively symptomatic with moderate efficacy,      estimated between 44 and 56%. The administration of culture-grown medullary mesenchymal stem      cells (MSCs) would be a curative treatment and have the advantage of being single injection.      However, the data in the literature do not allow to define the optimal dose of MSC in this      indication. In addition, the feasibility of this procedure is not known at present.      The aim of this study is to evaluate the tolerance and the efficacy of intracavernous      injection of autologous MSC (bone marrow-derived MSCs) administered in a 4-dose-escalating      design in patients from 18 to 50 years old with complicated type 1 diabetes mellitus and      erectile dysfunction.

",      The objective of our study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of the use of      autologous cultured adipose tissue-derived stem cells versus cultured autologous chondrocytes      for the treatment of chondral knee lesions.    ,"      Chondral knee lesions are frequent and produce important functional limitations and arthrosis      development. Arthrosis is one of the most important causes of disability and its treatment      with prosthetic surgery is associated with a high cost, and is not free of other      complications. Several studies of cell therapy with autologous chondrocytes have shown      efficacy in the treatment of this type of lesions, and currently is a common technique for      the treatment of focal lesions of articular cartilage. Autologous chondrocyte transplant is      associated with morbidity of the cartilage sample removal, which needs intra-articular      surgery, and the limited tissue sample for culture. Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem      cells (ASC) have demonstrated chondrocytic differentiation and have been used in animal      models for articular cartilage repair. Adipose tissue yields more ASC than chondrocytes are      obtained from cartilage, and liposuction is simple and with less adverse events than      arthroscopy. It is worth mentioned that culture conditions are less stringent for ASC than      for chondrocytes, in terms of number of passages to obtain the amount of cells needed for      implantation.      We propose a randomized clinical trial, in which we compare the surgical implantation of      either autologous chondrocytes or autologous ASC to treat chondral knee lesions.    ",,"

","      Despite the recent advances in medical and surgical treatment, heart failure resulting from      ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) remains the leading cause of cardiovascular mortality. Ischemic      dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV) cavity      with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD). LV      remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely to      the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal for      the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic      strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem      cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow.This study aims      to test the differentiation potential and therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD      patients after intracoronary implantation in an ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian      population.    ","      Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy(ICM) is defined as abnormally enlarged left ventricular (LV)      cavity with documented poor LV function as a result of severe coronary artery disease (CAD).      LV remodelling which is inevitable after an infarct has been postulated to contribute largely      to the poor outcome of patients with ICM, therefore prevention of LV remodelling is the goal      for the treatment in patients with severe CAD. Cell therapy represents a novel therapeutic      strategy for treating cardiac diseases including severe CAD and heart failure. A type of stem      cells known as mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)can be isolated from bone marrow. Experimental and      clinical studies to date have shown that mesenchymal stem cells represent the most suitable      cell type for regeneration therapy after myocardial infarction (MI). After injection into      ischemic myocardium, bone marrow-derived MSC (BM-MSC) from various animal species can      differentiate into multiple cell lineages, including endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes,      thereby improving LV function.      In Malaysia we have previously demonstrated our capability in isolating and extracting MSC      from a small volume of bone marrow aspirates.The isolation, expansion and feasibility of      storage, transport and differentiation of human MSC for clinical application has been      performed locally. The researchers used autologous BM-MSC, ex vivo expanded, on three      patients with end-stage ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who were on the heart transplant      waiting list and each patient was injected with MSCs directly into the myocardium during open      heart surgery. After twelve months, all patients remained alive and well with significant      improvement in cardiac function, quality of life and other parameters including reduction of      myocardial scar volume as seen from cardiac scans.      The same group of researchers further carried out a study on ten patients with severe dilated      cardiomyopathy and refractory cardiac function despite maximum medical therapy to receive      autologous BM-MSC implantation via intramyocardial or intracoronary route. All patients      remained alive at 1 year while recorded significant improvements in LV ejection fraction and      other LV parameters from baseline to 6 and 12 months. Reduction in scar was also noted in six      of the patients by 12 months.      Following these results, this study aims to test the differentiation potential and      therapeutic capacity of MSC from severe CAD patients after intracoronary implantation in an      ischemic myocardial environment in Malaysian population.

","      Subjects in this study have had an allogeneic (blood or marrow cells from another person)      blood or marrow transplant to treat leukemia, lymphoma or other cancer of the blood, and have      now developed Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) that is not responding to standard treatment.      GVHD is when the graft (transplanted bone marrow or blood) attacks the recipient's body. GVHD      occurs early after transplant (acute) and/or sometimes months after transplant (chronic).      Both forms can be life threatening; chronic GVHD can be a lifelong disabling condition.      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) exist in tissues throughout the body. One place they are      found is in the bone marrow and from here they can be obtained by needle aspiration, the same      way bone marrow samples are obtained to test for leukemia. This study uses autologous MSCs      obtained from the recipient with acute and/or chronic GVHD, which have a lower chance of      being rejected. These MSCs may promote tolerance, helping the donor immune cells accept the      recipient's body.      This trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly      cultured autologous MSC grown in platelet lysate-containing medium will modulate donor T-cell      immune responses and reduce GVHD in allo-HSCT recipients. As a phase I dose escalation trial      of autologous MSC in patients with acute and chronic GVHD, the main aim is to evaluate the      safety of this therapy and its effects on GVHD biomarkers and T-cell phenotype    ","      EPIC MSC2014-002 solution- Autologous Mesenchymal Stromal Cells expanded using pooled human      platelet lysate,is made up of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo      expanded numerically for approximately 14 days using pooled human Platelet Lysate (phPL),      harvested from culture on the day of infusion and suspended at a concentration of 4 million      cells/ml in Plasmalyte A with 0.5% human serum albumin. This is a phase I dose-escalation,      open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to evaluate      the safety and tolerability of EPIC MSC2014-002. The product will be infused intravenously      and will be administered at one of three dose levels: (Dose level 1): Single Cell infusion 2      x 10^6 cells/kg, (Dose Level 2): Two weekly Cell infusions 2 x 10^6 cells/kg , (Dose level      3): Four weekly Cell infusion 2 x 10^6 cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll      12-24 subjects with acute or chronic GVHD. The duration of this study for each patient is 1      year. The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 3 years of      commencement.      Objectives:        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of infusing escalating doses of autologous MSCs           for patients with acute or chronic GVHD.        -  To assess the overall response rate of acute and chronic GVHD to autologous MSC           infusion. These data will be used to plan future, larger clinical trials to evaluate the           efficacy of autologous MSCs for the treatment of GVHD.        -  To determine the effect of MSC infusion on lymphocyte phenotype, inflammatory biomarkers           and GVHD specific biomarker levels    ",,"

","      Ankle osteoarthritis is a joint condition which results from damage and loss of the cartilage      in a joint. Treatment options for ankle osteoarthritis are usually aimed at controlling pain      and limiting motion that provokes the pain. Nonsurgical treatment approaches are tried first.      If unsuccessful, surgical options are considered. Stem cell therapy is one of the therapeutic      options that can repair the damaged cartilage. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells      have showed the capacity of bone and cartilage regeneration.

","      The overall aim of the project is to develop a new method for treatment of untreatable severe      hoarseness due to vocal fold scarring by local injection of autologous mesenchymal stromal      cells (MSC). At present there is no lasting effective treatment for this condition which      results in personal suffering, and often extended sick leave, change of work or unemployement      for the patients.      Based on the previous results the investigators expect the autologous MSC product      KI-MSC-PL-204 to be a new effective treatment without side effects for many patients with      severe hoarseness or aphonia due to vocal fold scarring.    ","      The general aim of the project is to develop a treatment for severe hoarseness due to vocal      fold (VF) scarring. Vocal fold scarring can be caused by tumor surgery, radiotherapy, severe      inflammation or is early acquired (sulcus vocalis with scar) and results in stiff vocal folds      with decreased vibratory capacity and severe deterioration or total loss of voice (aphonia).      There is no lasting effective treatment. Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are      immunomodulatory, decrease inflammation and improve endogenous healing. After receiving      ethical permission the investigators have since 2012 treated 16 patients with manifest vocal      fold scarring and severe hoarseness by scar resection and local injection of autologous bone      marrow MSC to restore speech. This project was the first in the world to study the effects of      MSC treatment of vocal fold scarring in humans. Analysis was made before and up to 12 months      post operatively with voice recordings, examination with high speed camera and elasticity      measurements of the vocal folds with novel technology. No side effects were found for any      patient and for two thirds of the patients with 12 months follow-up the vocal fold function      improved and no patient deteriorated.      While cell therapy with autologous MSC was classified according to the Tissue Legislation      before 2015, it is now regarded as drug treatment. In accordance with this legislation, the      MSC production is now full scale GMP. The investigators have recently received permissions      from Swedish Medical Product Agency (DNr 5.1-2019-92069) and from the Regional ethic      committee (Drn 2019-06160) for an open Phase I/Il study in patients with severe dysphonia and      vocal fold scarring to evaluate safety, tolerability and vocal function after surgery with      local administration of autologous mesenchymal stromal cell product KI-MSC-PL-204 as an      extended study on 15 patients.      MSC may in the future be used to treat patients with severe hoarseness due to scarring, as      well as other damages in the airways.    ",,"

",,"      The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and therapeutic effects of transplantation      of escalating doses of autologous cultured mesenchymal bone marrow stromal cells secreting      neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF), in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).    ","      This is a phase IIa prospective, open label, dose-escalating, three patient-group clinical      study, to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of autologous cultured      mesenchymal bone marrow stromal cells secreting neurotrophic factors (MSC-NTF), as a potent      treatment for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) at the early disease stages.      This study is a single center trial. It is anticipated that the study will be conducted at      the Department of Neurology & Laboratory of Neuroimmunology, at the Hadassah Hebrew      University Medical Center, Jerusalem in Israel. In addition, ALS patients could also be      referred to the clinical site above by other medical centers.      All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study      enrollment. Patients diagnosed as early stage ALS disease with duration of less than 2 years.      ALS patients identified as ""predisposed"" will be approached and requested to sign an Informed      Consent Form (ICF). Overall, 14 patients will be recruited.      Treatment will start with the lowest dose (94x106 cells) and the dose will be increased to      the next medium and high dose (141x106 and 188x106 respectively), for the next patients group      only following safety analysis.      The expected duration of patient screening period prior to enrollment into this study is      in-between two weeks up to 2 days prior to the study enrollment day during visit 2      (verification of compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria including clinical laboratory      results). Eligible patients will be enrolled into the study and will be observed for every      month during a ""run in period"" of 3 months for determination of the progression rate of the      disease (allowing a time window of ± 5 days for all visits). During the ""run in period"" after      about 6 weeks following enrollment, patients of both study groups will undergo a Bone Marrow      Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC-NTF cells will be produced from the bone marrow aspirate      based on Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd proprietary method. On the last ""run in period""      visit, patients will undergo the treatment and MSC-NTF will be transplanted by IM+IT to the      early ALS patients.      After the MSC-NTF transplantation patients will be observed on a monthly basis for a post      treatment follow up period of 6 months (allowing a time window of ± 5 days for all visits).      Treatment safety, adverse events and exploratory parameters, to establish ALS progression      rate assessment of the disease will be recorded throughout the duration of the ""run in      period"" and the post treatment follow up period.

","      Immunomodulatory therapies to treat the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS)      are designed to ameliorate the inflammatory processes that mediate the damage to the central      nervous system (CNS) and to delay progression of the disease. To date, there is no effective      means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy      show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose      the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to      treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking      advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to      play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity and      that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single injection      of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility, safety and      tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the effects of      BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological, immunological      and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow aspirates, purified      by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single dose of autologous      BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and immunological assessments      will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at 1, 3, and 6 months after      transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after transplant. Proposed trial      will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a feasible and safe      procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an environment of immune tolerance and through      the local production of neurotrophic/growth factors, might induce neuroprotection and      improvement in CNS function.    ","      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Onset typically      occurs in early adulthood. Patients present with intermittent symptoms that are partially      reversible; this form is termed relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Over time, most patients develop      secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) which manifests as irreversible and gradual neurological      impairments that often progress without acute relapses. Beta-interferons or glatiramer      acetate represents the first line therapeutic option for RRMS. Clinical trials confirm that      show partial efficacy, though they do not prevent the onset of secondary progression. SPMS,      is the consequence of axonal loss and neurodegeneration and no current therapy has been      effective. Stem cell therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative      therapeutic strategy. Clinical indications for adult stem cells, which can be safely      harvested and normally behave well without formation of tumours, are rapidly increasing. The      majority of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic      stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both, which can be easily obtained in      clinically sufficient numbers from peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or      umbilical cord blood and placenta. MSC can readily be isolated from a small sample of bone      marrow and rapidly expanded so as to generate large numbers of cells for autologous      therapies. When administered intravenously have an immune suppressive effect that can      ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical      outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. When      intravenously injected, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival of      brain-resident cells. Several disease models demonstrate axonal neuroprotection following MSC      therapy, with some evidence that this is potentially mediated through the production of      neurotrophic/growth factors, and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSC. For that reasons, MSC      have become the focus of research as a potential cell therapy for inducing neuroprotection in      human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.      A growing body of literature confirms the therapeutic MSC biological properties, and provide      a plausible mechanism of action to guide clinical trial design with a number of phase I/II      trials in MS patients now underway. Experimental clinical trials in MS are being considered      or have recently been initiated by several research groups, which are testing the therapeutic      potential of different sources of MSC. Learning from previous clinical studies, and taking      advantage of the potential that adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair and remyelination, to plan      a clinical trial in patients with inflammatory MS seems reasonable. We propose a safety trial      of a single intravenous injection of autologous bone marrow-derived MSC into 8 subjects with      RRMS. The trial proposed here will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC      transplantation is a safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC therapy during the      relapsing-remitting phase of MS can establish a immunomodulatory and regenerative      microenvironment and reverse neurological disability in RRMS patients.

","      Bone fractures heal most of the time particularly well and without complications. The      solidification takes rarely more than two to three months. The wound healing depends greatly      on a good blood supply and needs several steps. These processes culminate in a new mass of      heterogeneous tissue which is known as the fracture callus. Unfortunately, 2%-5% bone      fractures cannot achieve a proper solidification and between the ununited fragments a scar      tissue appears. This incorrect healing induces pain and even infections. When this situation      persists more than 6 months, it is referred to as nonunion fracture, which will require some      form of intervention to stimulate the natural healing process of the body. First of all, good      surgical techniques with stable immobilization should be applied and local infection should      be excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is required. Cell therapy with bone marrow cells      has emerged as a promising new approach for bone regeneration. Animal studies as well as      preliminary human studies have shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells, a particular kind of stem      cells isolated from the bone marrow, could induce callus formation when injected in the      nonunion site of a broken bone.      In this study the investigators aim at determining whether Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC)      isolated from the patient's bone marrow and injected in the nonunion site could be a safe and      effective treatment for nonunion fractures. Patients will be randomized in two groups; one      injected with Mesenchymal Stem Cell and the other injected with placebo. The investigators      seek also to know how long it takes to develop the callus formation and whether there is a      partial or a complete callus formation.    ",,,"

","      Study Objects: Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused an immune reaction to      beta cells in the pancreas. In this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be used for immune      response modulation and improving regeneration. Study design and method: In a Triple blinded      randomized placebo-controlled phase I/II clinical trial, 20 patients with newly diagnosed      type-1 diabetes who would be visited in Children's Growth and Development Research Center of      Tehran University of Medical Sciences and Royan Institute Cell Therapy Center, would be      assessed through two groups including the case group and the placebo group. Participants:      Patients of both sexes in a range of 8 to 40 years old who have been diagnosed to have type-1      diabetes in no more than 6 weeks, antibody against beta cells diagnosed in their blood,      fasting c-peptide more than or equal to 0.3 ng/ml, and are not suffered from other acute or      chronic diseases and cancers, would be studied. Interventions: Intravascular transplantation      of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in the case group; placebo injection in the control      group. Outcome variables: safety and efficacy.    ","      Diabetes is an autoimmune disease which is mainly caused by an immune reaction to beta cells      in the pancreas. Today, insulin injection is a routine treatment for diabetes. Although      injected insulin maintains blood glucose, this method cannot result in physiologic reaction      to blood glucose changes. Moreover, patients are encountered with diabetes complications like      neuropathy, nephropathy, visual and cardiovascular problems, and hypoglycemic unawareness.      Therefore, based on previous studies, a treatment option that leads to pancreatic beta cell      restoration and inhibits the immune response to these cells could be a hopeful clinical      choice. In this clinical trial, autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells will be      used for immune response modulation and improving regeneration. Hence, based on inclusion and      exclusion criteria, 20 patients with type-1 diabetes will be selected and after clarifying      the procedure and fulfilling the agreement to participate in this trial, they will be sorted      in two groups. Bone marrow is aspirated from patients bone and after isolation of Mesenchymal      stem cells and characterization of these cells, patients in case group will be intravenously      injected by 1 million autologous mesenchymal stem cells per kg of patient's body weight in      each dose in week 0 and 3, whereas the control group receives a placebo. Then patients will      be followed up for 1 year. During this time, different parameters would be evaluated in weeks      1, 2,4, and Months 2,3,6,9 and 12. Laboratory screenings will be done during this period to      evaluate the safety and efficacy of this treatment.    ",,"

","        Inclusion Criteria          1. Participants aged 30-80 years old with a diagnosis of MSA based on clinical criteria             and standardized autonomic testing. This approach allows for identification of             patients with MSA with very high specificity and is yet sensitive enough to allow for             enrollment of patients at a disease stage at which an intervention on the natural             disease course has a meaningful impact on patient outcome. Patients therefore have to             fulfill Gilman Criteria (2000) for probable MSA of the parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) or             cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) and have findings on autonomic function testing suggestive             of MSA (CASS ≥5 or a TST% ≥25%).          2. Participants who are less than 4 years from the time of documented MSA diagnosis.          3. Participants with an anticipated survival of at least 3 years in the opinion of the             investigator.          4. Participants who are willing and able to give informed consent.          5. ""Normal"" cognition as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We will             require a value >24.        Exclusion Criteria        Any of the following conditions will exclude the participant from entering the study:          1. Women of childbearing potential who do not practice an acceptable method of birth             control. Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are: surgical             sterilization, intrauterine devices, partner's vasectomy, a double-protection method             (condom or diaphragm with spermicide), hormonal contraceptive drug (i.e., oral             contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long-acting injectable contraceptive) with a             required second mode of contraception.          2. Participants with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might preclude safe completion of the study             or might affect the results of the study. These include conditions causing significant             central nervous system (CNS) or autonomic dysfunction, including congestive heart             failure, recent (<6 months) myocardial infarct, cardiopulmonary disease, severe,             uncontrolled hypertension, thrombocytopenia (<50 x 10(9)/L), severe anemia (<8g/dl),             immunocompromised state, liver or kidney disease (creatinine >2.3mg/dl), uncontrolled             diabetes mellitus (HbA1c >10g%), alcoholism, amyloidosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism,             sympathectomy, unstable peripheral neuropathies, concurrent infections, orthopedic             problems that compromise mobility and activity of daily living, cerebrovascular             accidents, neurotoxin or neuroactive drug exposure, parkinsonism due to drugs             (including neuroleptics, alpha-methyldopa, reserpine, metoclopramide).          3. Participants with malignant neoplasms.          4. Participants who have taken any investigational products within 60 days prior to             baseline.          5. Medications that could affect autonomic function. If patients are taking those             medications, those will be suspended prior to autonomic testing. Therapy with             midodrine, anticholinergic, alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists or other medications             that affect autonomic function will be withdrawn 48 hours prior to autonomic             evaluations. Fludrocortisone doses up to 0.2 mg per day will be permitted.          6. Diseases with features of Parkinsons Disease; e.g., diffuse Lewy body disease,             progressive supranuclear palsy, essential tremor, hereditary olivopontocerebellar             atrophy, or postencephalitic parkinsonism.          7. Dementia (DSM-IV criteria - American Psychiatric Association 1994). The score on the             Mini-Mental State Examination must be >24.          8. History of electroconvulsive therapy.          9. History of brain surgery for Parkinsons disease.         10. Patients with contraindication for MRI scanning, including those with MRI-incompatible             pacemakers         11.

","      Background & Aim: Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have capacity to      differentiate into hepatocytes and anti-fibrotic effect in the experimental model. No study      was done in humans with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The researchers investigated the      anti-fibrotic effect of BM-MSCs in alcoholic cirrhosis as Phase II clinical study.      Methods: Eleven alcoholic cirrhosis patients (M:F = 10:1) with Child-Pugh's class B and      maintenance of alcohol abstinence at least 2 months were enrolled. At baseline, all patients      received liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and serologic      tests. BM-MSCs were isolated from each patient's BM and amplified for one month and injected      two times at 4, 8week through Rt. hepatic artery. 5x106cells/mL of BM-MSCs were injected in      each session. Follow up biopsy, HVPG and relative expression of tissue transforming growth      factor-1 (TGF-β1), α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen-1 by real time RT PCR were      measured after 12weeks from 2nd BM-MSC injection. The primary outcome was improvement in      patients' histology Aim :      The researchers aimed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of new therapy with bone marrow      derived autologous mesenchymal stem cell for hepatic failure caused by alcoholic liver      cirrhosis.

We have evaluated the characteristics of rat MSCs after      culture with fetal bovine serum (FBS) or serum obtained from rat stroke model. Compared to      FBS, the use of serum obtained from rat stroke model resulted in more rapid expansion of      MSCs, which reduces cell preparation time by increase in G2/M phase, decreased cell      death/senescence, increased trophic factor secretion, and increased migration capacity.

This study will enroll patients that have      persistent symptomatic perianal disease despite being treated with an MSC coated fistula      plug, and also treat patients that have had recurrence of their perianal fistula.      As per the previously approval treatment under IND 15356, patients will have a single      affected fistula treated, which is the same fistula that was treated in the original      protocol. The matrix for delivering the cells is a Gore Bio-A Fistula Plug.      Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified subjects will      be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study visit (Visit 1;      Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessment will be made if an EUA is      clinically necessary to assess the fistula. As this is a re-treatment trial, patients with      incomplete response to initial plug placement typically have close follow up, recent MRI      imaging, and may have a seton in place. If an EUA is clinically indicated, this would be by a      colorectal surgeon for drainage of sepsis and placement of a seton as part of the standard      clinical care for perianal fistula.

","      In this prospective study we aim to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the implantation      of 40 millions MSV in knees with osteoarthritis of grade II-IV (Kellgren and Lawrence). The      working hypothesis proposes that MSV antiinflammatory effect will help healing of articular      cartilage degeneration to a grade enough to be objectivized by questionnaires and imaging      procedures. The study of quantitative changes in structure and composition of cartilage      determined by MRI T2-mapping (Cartigram ) will be performed at 6, 12 and 24 months. Pain and      disability will be assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS), WOMAC, Lequesne Index and      evaluation of the quality of life by Short Form 36 questionnaire (SF-36) completed at 3, 6,12      and 24 months.    ","      Knee osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis. Treatments involve high costs in      terms of social and economic, are palliative and do not contemplate healing by regenerative      therapy. It has been shown recently, that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be expanded ""in      vitro"" and may regenerate several damaged or injured tissues. In addition its has      demonstrated that MSC are able to modulate immune responses and to control inflammation      through its action on T lymphocytes. Preliminary studies in animal models, including one      carried out in an equine by our research group, confirms feasibility, safety and efficacy      evidence proposed treatment protocol. Our research group has also experience in preparing      clinical-grade MSC from bone marrow for other clinical trials and has all the necessary      facilities and permissions to comply with GMPs imposed by recent EU legislation. Finally, our      clinical team has a wide experience in regenerative therapies in several previous clinical      trials for bone and cartilage.      We present here an alternative proposal, aiming to anti-inflammation and regeneration by      injection of single dose of mesenchymal stem cells expanded from autologous bone marrow by      the GMP-complying IBGM-Valladolid procedure (MSV). Treatment involves two non-invasive      surgical procedures with low morbidity: obtaining bone marrow under local anesthesia and      sedation, and 4 weeks later, articular injection of the cell product (20 millions MSVs). The      injection of cells does not even require anesthesia and obtaining bone marrow requires an      outpatient admission two hours following safety criteria.      Patients will be evaluated clinically, including pain score (VSA), pain and disability      indexes (WOMAC and Lequesne) and life quality (SF-36), and by radiologic and MRI procedures      no contrast and allowing quantification of morphological and structural changes of the      cartilage region studied (MRI T2-mapping).      The design of the study is an open-label prospective, multicenter study. It will recruit 12      patients with osteoarthritis of II-IV Kellgren and Lawrence grades, Patients will be      evaluated clinically by previous studies imaging (X-rays and MRI). If they are eligible for      the study we shall provide them information about the clinical trial with the ""Patient      Information Sheet, quoting them for the Inclusion Visit. In the ""Inclusion Visit"" if the      patient decides to participate in the test should sign the Informed Consent Document and a      schedule for MRI and X-rays will be scheduled. The results of this exploration will be      considered the standard to which compare any given change in the controls at 6 and 12 months.      On this visit, routine preoperative examinations are performed (EKG, chest X-ray AP, basic      analytic coagulation tests and identification of HIV, Lues and hepatitis B and C and the      valuation by the Internal Medicine Service).      During the visit V0 we shall verify that all inclusion criteria persist and not exclusion      criteria have appeared, and we shall program V1 (to obtain bone marrow) and provide a      preliminary date for MSV injection 4 week later (V2). After application, the patients will      have follow-up schedule at 8 days (V3), 3 (V4), 6 (V5), 12 (V6) and eventually 24 months (V7)      as detailed below.      V0: Eligibility. Clinical History.

Magnetic Resonance imaging measurements of T2 relaxation (Cartigram) performed at 0, 6 and 12 months to quantify articular cartilage degeneration. The values (in milliseconds) are T1/2 for decay of the T2 MRI signals. Normal values are below 50 ms; values above 50 ms correspond to inflamed cartilage.
Mean (SD) are expressed as the percent of values (of a total of 88 measurements) that are between 50 and 90 ms. A value =5 is considered normal (can be attained by chance). Values above 5 are considered pathological. The worst possible is 100.

",      This study is intended to look at the safety and efficacy of the use of autologous bone      marrow derived stem cell transplant in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.    ,"      Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder, still at its best can only be controlled      by medical or surgical treatment. For more than two decades various groups have tried using      modified cell transplants for curing this disease. Earlier results with use of fetal      mesencephalic cell transplant were encouraging, but this had to be discontinued due to severe      side effects.      Current interest, in the use of Mesenchymal stem cells as a pluripotent cell for developing      neural cells has been the background for this study. Reliance Life sciences had found      encouraging results with the use of human MSCs in Rat model of PD. Based on this and other      data, Jaslok Hospital and Research Centre has initiated a pilot study to investigate the      efficacy of Autologous MSCs in treating advanced PD. This cells will be harvested from bone      marrow, processed at RLS laboratory and transplanted by stereotactic techniques into the      striatum of the patient.    ","

","      Lipodystrophies are part of a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by      loss (lipoatrophies) and / or accumulation of fat, which usually results in a change of      normal tissue surface. Millions of plastic and reconstructive surgeries are performed      annually to repair soft tissue defects due to trauma, tumor resection and congenital defects.      Surgical options for lipoatrophy, the lipodystrophy type characterized by subcutaneous      adipose tissue atrophy, include: Transfer of autologous fat, Dermis - fat graft, Skin flaps      and Commercially available fillers.      Currently, the most commonly filler agent used for the lipodystrophy treatment is      polymethylmethacrylate, considered permanent and with a history of short- and medium-term      adverse effects. Biocompatible and temporary filler agents such as hyaluronic acid,      polylactic acid and collagen have been used for over 25 years for cosmetic purposes and in      lipoatrophies. More recently, the use of autologous fibroblasts proved to be efficient      solving acne scars and enabling dermis regeneration. Studies in mice showed that the      combination of pre - adipocytes with a biomaterial is much more effective in tissue      reconstitution than the injection of adipose tissue only, providing volume and also      stimulating cell proliferation and differentiation with increased production of extracellular      matrix.      This project aims a phase I clinical trial of a filler agent, composed of mesenchymal stem      cells derived from autologous adipose tissue associated with hyaluronic acid.    ","      Open, controlled and randomized study. The intervention performed in this study will be the      transdermal injection of the filler agent in patients undergoing elective cosmetic      liposuction procedure, with legal age and without any of the exclusion criteria items.      Patients will be evaluated according to the parameters for a total period of 12 months.      Individuals in the control group will have transdermal injection of hyaluronic acid and will      be evaluated with the same parameters used for the study group and also for the same period.      In this study, 25 volunteers attended at Dermatologic Service of the Bonsucesso Federal      Hospital (HFB) will be included.      The research subjects will be evaluated preliminarily regarding inclusion and exclusion      criteria of the study and the procedure will only be performed after the signing of the      Informed Consent Form (ICF).      The efficacy and safety study will be conducted following Good Laboratory and Clinics      Practices.      Patients who meet the study eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the two      treatment groups: Test or Control.      The first follow-up visit will occur in the first month post-procedure. Subsequent      consultations will be held at 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure.    ",,"

Induction therapy with antibody plus the maintenance immunosuppressive agents have greatly      improved graft survival in renal transplantation. Since mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs)have been      used successfully to treat graft versus host disease and show immune modulation function both      in vitro and in vivo and may help in repairing damaged tissue(s), we evaluate autologous MSCs      as an alternative for antibody induction therapy.

","      Multiple sclerosis is a multifocal inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which      affects young individuals and causes paralysis of the limbs, sensation, visual and sphincter      problems. The disease is caused by an autoimmune mechanism, ie the immune system produces      antibodies and cells which attack the self myelin antigens, causing therefore demyelination.      The disease is clinically evident with relapses of neurological disability due to the      dysfunction of the areas (plaques of multiple sclerosis) in which damage of myelin occurs.      Disability can accumulate with time and the disease enters a progressive phase due to damage      of the axons and irreversible neurodegeneration. Although, effective immunotherapies exist      which downregulate the autoimmune anti-myelin reactivity and reduce the rate of relapses of      MS (like Copaxone and interferons), there is no effective means today to stop the progression      of disability and induce rebuilding of the destroyed myelin.Adult bone marrow derived stromal      cells (MSC) were shown to induce similar (to the neuronal stem cells) immunomodulatory and      neuroregenerative effects and were shown in our laboratory to induce neuroprotection in the      animal model of chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). These bone marrow      derived MSCs offer practical advantages for clinical therapeutic applications, since they can      be obtained from the adult bone marrow and therefore the patient can be the donor for      himself, without any danger for rejection of the cells. In addition, MSCs carry a safer      profile and are less prone to malignant transformation.      Our center will perform a clinical trial with intra venous transplantation of bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stem cell.our purpose is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of cell      transplantation after 1year following up.    ",      In the clinical trial 30 patients with multiple sclerosis who are drug resistance will take      apart.Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria patients are chosen.Bone marrow aspiration      will be done for all of them under local anesthesia.Patients are randomly divided in 2      groups:case and control. Then mesenchymal stem cells which are separated and prepared will be      transplanted by intravenous injection to the patients in case group and the cells which      obtain from patients in control group are frozen and inject after 6 months. Patients will be      followed by Evaluation of EDSS MSFC RAO Test brain and cervical MRI and quality of life      questionnaire after 1th 3th 6th and 12th months after transplantation.all these tests will be      done before transplantation as basic evaluation.    ,,"

Methods:      patients were randomized into the A group and the B group by use of a randomization table.      One lower limb in A group or in B group was selected randomly for MSCs or MNCs      transplantation as MSCs or MNCs group, the other lower limb in the same patient was selected      for placebo（normal saline ,NS）injection as NS group.      The whole procedures of this clinical trial were blinded to both patients and      investigators.Patients in both groups received the same ordinary treatment. Meanwhile, MSCs      and MNCs were transplanted into the impaired lower limbs respectively. Follow-up index      include: efficacy (pain,ulcer healing rate, lower limb amputation rate and ,ankle-brachial      index,Transcutaneous oxygen pressure,magnetic resonance angiography) and safety (infection of      the injection site, immunological rejection, and tumour generation).    ","      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Type 2      diabetic patients with bilateral critical limb ischemia (ankle-brachial index, ABI from 0.30      to 0.60) and at least with one foot ulcer, but without malignant tumor or gangrene above the      ankle and/or severe coronary, cerebral and renal vascular disease, were eligible for the      participation in this trial. Eligible patients took part in this study on a voluntary basis.      They were randomized into the A and B group by use of a randomization table. One lower limb      in A group or in B group was selected randomly for BMMSCs or BMMNCs transplantation as BMMSCs      or BMMNCs group, the other lower limb in the same patient was selected for placebo（normal      saline ,NS）injection as NS group.

","        Inclusion Criteria:          -  Diagnosis of MS as defined by the McDonald criteria          -  Diagnosis of primary progressive or secondary progressive MS          -  Patients will be 18 years or older          -  Significant disability shown by an Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS, [5]) ≥4.5             that was not acquired within the last 12 months *(Patients with moderate to severe             cerebellar dysfunction who have an EDSS of <6.5 who are not eligible for our Ph II             Version Date: 11/21/18 Version #4 9 study will be included. This is because EDSS             scores are heavily related to muscle strength and not balance or coordination and most             accurately reflect paraparesis. Also there are patients with MS who have disabling             upper limb coordination dysfunction but EDSS scores of better than 6.5 who are not             suitable for the Phase II study but may benefit from this therapy).          -  Stable disease state as evidenced by a lack of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on an MRI             and by a stable MRI disease burden (number of T2 lesions and size of lesions) in the             last six months and no significant change in EDSS (1 point or more) in the last 12             months          -  Does not qualify for the inclusion/exclusion criteria of our Phase II stem cell trial.             For example, patients with EDSS >6.5 or MS symptom onset and/or duration of disease             >15 years        Exclusion Criteria:          -  All patients who have had any prior stem cell treatments, including HSCT          -  Pregnant or nursing mothers or any woman intending to become pregnant in the next             three years          -  Use of systemic chemotherapeutic or anti-mitotic medications within three months of             study start date due to the possibility of interference with bone marrow procedure          -  History of central nervous system infection or immunodeficiency syndromes due to             increased risk of CNS infection          -  Patients who are anticipated to have difficultly accessing the intrathecal space             related to scoliosis, obesity, or any other relevant factors determined by the PI.          -  Patients who have not tried available therapies for their progressive MS      All18 Years70 Years","

","      Treatment of nonunion, delayed union and malunion fractures of long bones remains      problematic. The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in      a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third      and sixth month after the fracture. First of all good surgical techniques are stable      immobilization must be obtained and local sepsis excluded. Then stimulation of the callus is      required. Numerous techniques have been developed ranging from invasive interventions      (including internal fixation with the use of bone graft or bone graft substitutes) to non      invasive procedures (ultrasound and pulsed electromagnetic fields).      Recently, autologous cell therapy was presented as an interesting approach. The concept of      such therapies is based on the effect of stem cells presented in the bone marrow and able to      be transformed in osteoblast cells. The purpose of this study is to find if mesenchymal stem      cells can stimulate bone regeneration in nonunion and delayed union fractures to reduce later      surgeries required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.    ","      Treatment of nonunion, delayed union and malunion fractures of long bones remains      problematic. The definition of nonunion is a failure of the fracture to heal in six months in      a patient in whom progressive repair had not been observed radiographically between the third      and sixth month after the fracture. Nonunion is a serious complication of a fracture,      occurring in 2-10% of patients, as it is associated with high economic and health burden.      Many cases are subsequently approached by multiple surgical and nonsurgical modalities.      Various devices, under the name of ""bone growth stimulators"" have been used to enhance      healing of the fracture. Recent studies, demonstrated the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells      in regeneration of bone and cartilage tissue. In this study percutaneous injection of      mesenchymal stem cells to the site of fracture is performed as an outpatient procedure or      during an operative exposure to evaluate its efficacy in enhancing bone regeneration. In the      case of small size of bone gap, mesenchymal stem cells are injected into the callus of      fracture site through an outpatient procedure under the guide of fluoroscopy. If there is a      large bone gap, through a surgical management, mesenchymal stem cells seeded on bone matrix      are placed at the site of fracture. Patients are followed by X-Ray examination 1,2,6, and 12      months after treatment.    ",,"

","      Osteoarthritis is a progressively degenerative disease resulting in increasing pain,      impairment and ultimately disability. While the available treatments seek to ameliorate pain      or improve mobility, these treatments rarely modify the course of the disease, but rather      attend to its consequences. For early stage osteoarthritis, treatment is largely limited to      addressing the symptoms of inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).      These drugs do not stop the progression of the condition or regenerates damaged cartilage.

","      ACTIVE is a phase II B efficacy monocenter, prospective, randomized, controlled double      blinded trial, in which intra-discal autologous adult BM-MSC therapy will be compared with      sham treated controls.      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSCs in      workers affected by chronic low back pain (LBP) unresponsive to conventional therapy.      The efficacy will be evaluated 12 months after the treatment in terms of pain relief (VAS,      Visual Analog Scale), functionality (ODI, Oswestry Disability Index), quality of life (SF36,      Short Form - 36) and work ability index (WAI).    ","      Low back pain (LBP) is the main cause of disability in the world, affecting all occupational      sectors with different incidence rates. It is estimated that 60 percent of all workers suffer      from LBP during their careers, 10 percent of which become chronic (The Lancet. September      2017). Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to      LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent of cases. A key characteristic of IDD is loss of      matrix integrity and biomechanical functional failure. Today, no therapy can restore      intervertebral disc (IVD) function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD. Current      therapies are aimed at pain reduction. When these treatments fail, several types of surgery      are performed but they are often related to side effects, disturbance of motion and other      biomechanical consequences. New strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage.      Encouraging results from phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that cell-based regenerative      therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for LBP. LBP patients treated with      bone marrow mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (BM-MSC) showed rapid and progressive improvement      of functional indexes of 65 percent to 78 percent over 1 year after intradiscal      administration without side effect. ACTIVE is an ambitious randomized clinical trial aimed at      developing a treatment for IDD based on intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC to improve      the quality of life of workers and the disability of patients with LBP. ACTIVE main aim is to      generate efficacy and safety profiles of single injections of 15 million cells/mL of      autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to 4 discs) versus sham procedure. The      regenerative potential of BM-MSC treatment will be assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging      (MRI) technologies on quarterly basis up to 12 months.    ",,"

",      This is a study to assess safety and preliminary clinical activity of treatments of liver      cirrhosis in patients with caused by Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B or Nonalcoholic      Steatohepatitis of Mesenchymal stem cell.      Patients who will be enrolled in the study will be under supervision and monitoring to ensure      clinical significance    ,"      Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of      the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection,      excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the      cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.      Liver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once      liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice,      ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival      drops to about 50%.      The definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver      transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related      mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a      limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus      the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated      as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients      who had autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function      in these patients with cirrhotic livers.      The sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver      cirrhosis in Ukraine. This will be a Phase I study with the main emphasis on the safety and      efficiency profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP      and local regulatory requirement(s).    ",,"

","      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition      in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes      the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint      movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from      OA.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means      they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells      (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of      osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study,      researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing      side effects. This will be done by starting at a low dose of MSCs and moving on to the next      higher dose level provided there are no safety concerns. Researchers will also be looking at      the function of the knee over time, which may give them some insight on the usefulness of      MSCs as a treatment option.    ","      The trial is a non-randomized, open-label, dose escalation phase I/II clinical trial. A total      of 12 participants will be enrolled - patients will be treated in cohorts of 3 to determine      the safety and preliminary efficacy of autologous, ex-vivo expanded bone-marrow derived MSC      injected into the knee joint in patients with moderate to advanced knee osteoarthritis.      A minimum of three evaluable patients will be entered at each dose level until the maximum      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. Toxicity will be evaluated and graded according to the      Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events, as Grade 3-4. If a patient is      discontinued due to a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (i.e. dose-limiting toxicity, DLT), an      additional patient will be enrolled at the same dose level to ensure that a minimum of 3      patients are evaluated. If 0/3 patients experience dose-limiting (DLT) at a given dose level,      then the dose will be escalated for next cohort of 3 patients. If 1/3 patients experience DLT      at a given dose level, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at that dose level. If      no other patient experiences a DLT, dose escalation will continue. If DLT occurs in 2/3 or      2/6 patients, dose escalation will stop and the prior dose level will be declared the MTD for      the MSC cell infusions in this study.    ",,"

Several efficacy measures are      assessed as secondary endpoints.      Applications from patients are received in our centre. An independent selective committee set      by hospital's administration examines anonymously, according to the predefined inclusion and      exclusion criteria. After inclusion and screening visit, patients are followed up for a      ""run-in"" period of 6 months before the first visit (visit 1), to evaluate the progression      rate of their disease. and for six months following the last transplantation.      One month after inclusion, patients undergo bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) procedure and MSC      cells are produced from the bone marrow aspirate. On the treatment visit, the patients are      transplanted with an intrathecal (IT) injection of MSC (1 million cells per kg of body      weight) and thereafter with additional injections every 3-6 months. After the MSC      transplantation patients are examined on a bimonthly basis and evaluated for ALSFRSr scoring      and forced vital capacity of the lungs (FVC) for a total follow up period of 3 months post      last MSC-injection.      To establish the progression rate of the disease the monthly changes in the functional ALS      score: ALSFRSr will be calculated during the 6 months-""run in period"" and for the whole      duration of the study, ending at 3 months following the last injection of MSC stem cells. The      progression rate (as evidenced by the monthly changes in ALSFRSr and FVC) during the study      (calculated at last visit time point, 3 months after the last MSC-injection) will be compared      to the progression rate during the ""run-in"" period.      The follow up visits include observation for side effects, full neurological evaluation and      muscle chart, ALS score and forced vital capacity (FVC) test. The safety is assessed      following treatment with MSC, using measurements of the following variables: physical      examination, vital signs (HR, BP, RR, body temperature), and clinical laboratory parameters:      WBC with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), blood chemistry      for electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes.      All selected patients undergo bone marrow aspiration under light general anaesthesia and an      inoculum of crude bone marrow cells (150 ml) is obtained and two thirds of it kept frozen.      One third is cultured under GCP conditions at the human cell cultures clean room facility of      Hadassah HMO. The MSCs are obtained from the bone marrow of each patient and prepared using      our previously described protocol with slight modification.      One month later the patient is hospitalized and a lumbar puncture performed under standard      conditions and local anaesthesia at the L4-5 lumbar level and 3 ml of CSF are removed and the      cultured purified MSCs (1x106/kg of body weight) resuspended in 3 ml of normal saline are      injected in the CSF, using a 20-gauge needle and 3-way cannula.

","      Though the results of autologous CD34+ cell infusion and MSC in independent studies have      shown promise, yet they are yet to reach the desired long term outcome. The possible      postulation for this is possibly because when using autologous CD34+ cell infusion, the      inflammatory milieu of the liver may not be conducive for sustained effects of the mobilized      CD 34+ cells. MSC have immunomodulatory effect (ref) and may improve the liver environment      making it more beneficial for the CD34+ cells to function and survive. In addition, MSC has      ben shown to produce hepatocyte growth factor which is protective against liver injury and      beneficial for liver regeneration (shown in above tables). However, it remains to be      understood how MSCs promote liver stem stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes or expand      the residual hepatocyte population. MSC can also directly inhibit the activation of hepatic      stellate cells, the main source of extracellular matrix via MSC derived IL 10 and TNF-αand      may also induce hepatic stellate cell apoptosis. Current lacunae in cell based therapy is      based on the poor consensus and understanding on the best type of cells to be used, the ideal      number of cells, the most appropriate route of administration and the need for repeat dosing      . The concept that combination of autologous hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells      infusion may be more beneficial than infusing any one of them alone has been discussed in      many scientific forums but there are no study till date to either see the safety as well as      the efficacy of this proof of concept .      With this above background data, we propose a study design which will be a safety study for      combination use of autologous CD34+ and MSC    ",,,"

","      Transplant rejection is one of the biggest limitations in renal transplant procedures, where      the kidney can undergo an acute, late acute, or chronic transplant rejection. With the      advancement in transplantation protocols, acute survival of renal transplants has improved,      but long-term survival is still unsatisfactory, as most of the renal transplants develop      chronic graft rejection. Unfortunately, there is little the investigators know when it comes      to improving long-term survival of renal transplants. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been      shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. The purpose of this study is to      find out whether MSC in combination with standard therapy of antibody mediated rejection      (ABMR) are more effective in preventing organ deterioration and maintaining kidney function.    ","      Participants will be assigned to receive the full immunosuppressive therapy indicated to      treat chronic ABMR (including plasmapheresis (PF) 7x, intravenous immune globulins 100 mg/kg      7x, corticosteroid) and MSC infusions (2x106cells/kg bw after PF) (Group 1) and be compared      to historic controls according to ""propensity score matching"" (treated with immunosuppressive      therapy alone (Group 2)). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study after      each PF. One year post- infusions, patients will be evaluated and undergo kidney biopsies.      Blood collection will occur at regular intervals, serum creatinine and the estimated      creatinine clearance will be monthly recorded. The transplanted kidney function and      morphology (US Doppler) will be evaluated.    ","

","      DREAM is a phase II B efficacy monocentric, prospective, randomized, controlled double      blinded trial, comparing intra-discal autologous adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells      (BM-MSC) therapy and sham treated controls in subjects with chronic (> 6 months) Low Back      Pain (LBP) due to lumbar multilevel (max. 3 levels) intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD)      unresponsive to conventional therapy.      Duration of the recruitment period has been estimated to be 12 months. The efficacy of      intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC in reducing chronic LBP due to multilevel lumbar      IDD will be evaluated after 24 months in terms of pain relief (VAS), functionality (ODI) and      quality of life (SF36).    ","      Low back pain (LBP) is the global leading cause of disability, and furthermore rates sixth in      terms of overall disease burden, in both developed and developing countries. LPB is a      condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global      population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age,      and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP      will increase substantially over coming years.      Current LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment.      Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual      and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.      In a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex      spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration      (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent      of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby      causing biomechanical functional failure.      Today, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD.      New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research      offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly      promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that      cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this      common and debilitating disease.      The objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single      injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to      3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying      therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be      assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years.    ",,"
Randomized
Parallel Assignment
Patients will be randomized in 2 arms of 26 patients and followed up for 24 months.
Treatment
Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)
The randomization will be centralized and stratified on the investigation center. Treatment allocation will be performed 24 hour-a-day online by a central randomization web-service. The patient identification must be unique within all randomizations performed. For double-blind trial the randomization result will be a treatment code. Blinding or masking will be carried out at all stages of packaging and conditioning for shipping following the treatment allocation. Injections used for all groups will be clear and indistinguishable from each other.
","Pain ChangeFrom Baseline to Month 24Changes in pain will be evaluated on Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) between baseline and month 24. VAS scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable., Functional disability index evaluationFrom Baseline to Month 24Functional disability changes will be assessed on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) at month 24 compared with baseline. ODI scale ranges from 0 to 50 and allows evaluation of disability (0 - 20 percent: minimal disability; 20 - 40 percent: moderate disability; 40 - 60 percent: severe disability; 60 - 80 percent: crippled; 80 - 100 percent: bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms).","
Disability evolution
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Disability evolution includes Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) scores. SF-36 scores consist of eight 0-100 scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health) where a lower score corresponds to more disability and a higher score corresponds to less disability.
, 
Quality of life evolution
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Quality of life evolution includes global assessment by the patient and the physician.
The global assessment by the patient and the physician involves evaluation of: - Overall pain intensity in the lumbar spine (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = extreme); - patient's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor); - physician's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor).
, 
Drug consumption of rescue painkillers medication
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
The decrease/increase in the use of rescue medication will be recorded throughout the study duration by a diary file. A reduction in dose or frequency of administration of painkillers is an indirect marker of the benefits of MSC therapy.
, 
Measurement of pain
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Assessed by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). VAS pain scale ranges from 0 to 100: where 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable. In brief, the patients will fill VAS tests indicating the amount of pain experienced at rest and in motion.
, 
Employment and work status assessment
Baseline and 24 months
For this the investigators will assign each of the patients to one of 4 categories designated as ""employable"" which included those who were unemployed due to pain, employed but on sick leave, laid off, or working. The other categories include retired, disabled, and elderly at least 60 years of age, eligible for social security.
, 
Structural assessment
Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months
Evolution of affected disc(s) by quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) density measurements in T2 and T1 spin/echo and T1 rho weighted images used as an indication of disc fluid and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) content. The ""quality"" of the patient's lumbar disc/discs will be monitored non invasively using T2 weighted MRI sagittal images and, in T1 spin/echo MRI. Lumbar disc grading will be performed in the sagittal T2 weighted images by two physicians independently who were experienced in MRI of the spine. They will review each intervertebral disc from L1-2 to L5-S1 by the modified Pfirrmann criteria. The modified Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade 1 to 8 for disc degeneration.
, 
Evaluation of costs
12 and 24 months
The investigators will compare the medical and non-medical costs between the two groups of patient. For this purpose, resource use in each arm will be collected in physical units in the eCRF (electronic case report form) at the clinical centre as follows:
Acute care medical hospitalisations related to IDD
Acute care surgical hospitalisations related to IDD
Rehabilitation hospitalisations related to IDD
Analgesics
Work disruption
, 
Body Mass Index evaluation
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Evaluation of changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) through the measurement of weight (kg) and height (m) of each subject enrolled in the study.
, 
Haematological evaluation: safety parameter
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
The investigators will assess the percentage of patients who will develop haematological disorders. For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine haematological parameters (haematocrit, haemoglobin, RBC, WBC) to monitor the physiological status of the patient.
, 
Coagulation status: safety parameter
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
The investigators will assess the incidence of disorders related to coagulation. For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine coagulation parameters (INR, PTT) to monitor the coagulation status and hemostasis risks of each subject.
, 
Metabolic functions: safety parameter
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
The investigators will evaluate the incidence of metabolic alteration in patients recruited. For this reason, participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to determine biochemical parameters (Electrolytes, Creatinine, ALT, AST, AP, Bilirubin) to monitor the metabolic function of liver and kidney.
, 
Inflammation: safety parameter
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Blood sampling will be used to determine the concentration of C-Reactive Protein (CRP). Participants will undergo blood sampling for routine laboratory testing to monitor inflammatory response in each subject.
, 
Urinalysis
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Participants will undergo to urinalysis which consists in routine urine tests for the semiquantitative assessment of urinary characteristics to monitor the physiological status of the subjects.
, 
Spine examination
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Participants will undergo to spine examination for the identification of relevant clinical signs. The clinicians will evaluate: abnormalities in gait (pattern of walking); spinal range of motion (eg, bend forward); posture and spinal alignment (such as scoliosis or kyphosis).
,

","      There is evidence suggesting that stem cells harvested from the bone marrow and transplanted      into the brain may be effective in slowing down the progression of parkinsonism. Mesenchymal      stem cells are able to produce growth factors that provide support to diseased nervous cells.      In this study mesenchymal stem cells will be harvested from the bone marrow, cultivated in a      test tube so that they multiply and then infused into the arteries that supply blood to the      brain in 20 patients suffering from a rare form of parkinsonism, Progressive Supranuclear      Palsy. Each patient will undergo two infusions, one with the stem cells and one without, at      an interval of 6 months. The sequence of the two infusions will be assigned randomly;      patients and assessors will not know the sequence (double-blind). Patients will be      followed-up for up to 1 year after the last infusion, with regular assessments to assess      safety, efficacy on motor and cognitive functions, and effects on the brain by neuroimaging      techniques.

","      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the      safety and efficacy of autologous (self) transplantation of Neurotrophic factors-secreting      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC-NTF, NurOwn™) in patients with ALS .      MSC-NTF cells are a novel cell-therapeutic approach which is expected to effectively deliver      Neurotrophic factors, which are potent survival factors for neurons, directly to the site of      damage.    ","      The MSC-NTF cell therapy (NurOwn™) is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patients' own bone      marrow, propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete NTFs. The autologous MSC-NTF cells are      back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the      muscles.      NTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are      considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the      immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their      survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.      Previous open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well      tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit      were also observed in some patients.      This multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the      safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of      MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three      months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this      period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be      isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six      months at monthly visits.    ",,"

","      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of repeated administration of NurOwn®      (MSC-NTF cells) therapy, which is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patient's own bone marrow,      propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete Neurotrophic factors (NTFs).      The autologous NurOwn® (MSC-NTF cells) are back-transplanted into the patient intrathecally      by standard lumbar puncture where neurons and glial cells are expected to take up the      neurotrophic factors secreted by the transplanted cells    ","      Neurotrophic factors (NTFs) are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult      neurons and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of multiple      NTFs to the immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve      their survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms. NTF-secreting      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-NTF cells) are a novel cell-therapeutic approach aimed at      effectively delivering NTFs directly to the site of damage in ALS patients.      Participants meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized and will undergo      bone-marrow aspiration. MSC of the participants randomized to the treatment group will be      induced into MSC-NTF cells.

",,"      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, the feasibility and the efficacy of      transendocardial injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients      with dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy.    ","      Chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is a public health problem that entails high rates of      morbidity and mortality, and enormous costs for health systems worldwide. In the United      States there are 5 million people living with CHF, and each year 60.000 people reach terminal      phases of the disease, with mortality rates of 70-80% at two years. Although the first cause      of CHF in developed countries is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD), dilated      idiopathic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents almost half of the cases of newly diagnosed CHF.      Treatment of CHF includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies, including      implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy and heart      transplantation. Despite all these advances, CHF prognosis remains poor. Cardiac stem cell      therapy emerged more than ten years ago as a new hope for CHF patients.      Although the most extensive evidence of the benefits of stem cell therapy for cardiovascular      diseases refers to ischemic heart disease (CAD), initial experiences with stem cells for      other conditions such as DCM are encouraging.      This randomized clinical trial will include 70 patients with DCM, left ventricular ejection      fraction (LVEF) between 20% and 45%, and who are symptomatic in New York Heart Association      (NYHA) functional class II-III/IV. In a first-in-man pilot phase, 10 patients will be treated      with transendocardial injections of bone marrow-derived MSCs after cardiac catheterization      and NOGA XPTM mapping of the left ventricle. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will      analyse the safety and feasibility of this first phase of the trial, and then 60 patients      more will be randomized to receive MSCs or placebo (ratio 3:1).      Primary objectives include safety and feasibility variables, and secondary objectives include      efficacy variables. All patients will be studied with a complete cardiac imaging protocol      that includes: electrocardiography, echocardiography, treadmill tests with oxygen      consumption, holter, laboratory analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon      emission computed tomography (SPECT), electromechanical mapping (NOGA XPTM) and quality of      life questionnaires.

","      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed      cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and      able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered      cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the      surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this      may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft      cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a      number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and      neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered      contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone      marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been      substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast      preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic      ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority      of the trials.      Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy      in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible      patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for      acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.    ","      This is a Pilot Study, intended as a safety assessment prior to a full comparator study. In      this Pilot Study, cells administered via the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA injection catheter      system will be tested in 36 patients in two groups:      Group 1 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Auto-hMSCs: 20 million      cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108      (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.      Group 2 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Allo-hMSCs: 20 million      cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108      (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.      The first three (3) patients in each group (Group 1 and Group 2) will not be treated less      than 5 days apart and will each undergo full evaluation for 5 days to demonstrate there is no      evidence of a procedure induced myocardial infarction or myocardial perforation prior to      proceeding with the treatment of further patients.      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups.      Treatment Strategies: Autologous hMSCs vs. Allogeneic hMSCs. The Study Team will record and      maintain a detailed record of injection locations.      If a patient is randomized to Groups 1 (Auto-hMSCs) and the Auto-hMSCs do not expand to the      required dose of 1 X 108 cells, each injection will contain the maximum number of cells      available.      The injections will be administered transendocardially during cardiac catheterization using      the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Catheter System.      For patients randomized to Group 1(Auto-hMSCs); the cells will be derived from a sample of      the patient's bone marrow (obtained by iliac crest aspiration) approximately 4-6 weeks prior      to cardiac catheterization. For patients randomized to Group 2 (Allo- hMSCs), the cells will      be supplied from an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source manufactured by the      University of Miami. The Allo-hMSCs for patients in group 2 will be administered after all      baseline assessments are completed with an expected range of 2 - 4 weeks post-randomization.      Following cardiac catheterization and cell injections, patients will be hospitalized for a      minimum of 2 days then followed at 2 weeks post-catheterization, and at month 2, 3, 6, and 12      to complete all safety and efficacy assessments.

","      This observational study aims at assessing the safety and efficacy profiles of mesenchymal      stem cell, in different formats (SVF, autologous, allogenic), to treat complex perianal      fistula according to the Spanish national Compassionate-use law .    ","      Under controlled circumstances, and approved by European and Spanish laws, a      Compassionate-use Program allows the use of stem-cell therapy for patients with non-healing      diseases, mostly complex fistula-in-ano, who do not meet criteria to be included in a      clinical trial. Candidates had previously undergone multiple surgical interventions that had      failed. The intervention consisted of surgery (with closure of the internal opening or a      surgical flap performance), followed by stem cells injection. Three types of cells were used      for implant: stromal vascular fraction, autologous expanded adipose-derived or allogenic      adipose derived stem cells.      Healing was evaluated at 6th month follow-up. Outcome was classified as partial response or      healing. Relapse was evaluated 1 year later. Maximum follow up period was 48 months.    ",,"

","      This is a pilot-study of 16 selected Swedish patients which all have severe hoarseness or      aphonia due to vocal fold scarring (from previous surgery, radiation therapy, inflammation or      possibly hereditary). The patients are operated with phonomicrosurgical dissection of the      scarred vocal folds, removal or scar tissue and injection of autologous mesenchymal stroma      cells, aMSC (which were previously harvested from each patients´s bone marrow, purified,      expanded and characterized according to standard procedure at the Center of Hematology and      Regenerative Medicine Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge). 8 Patients is planned to be      treated with a single injection of aMSC and 8 patients with injection of aMSC mixed with a      carrier hyaluronan gel developed at Uppsala University Sweden and at the Karolinska      Institute. The laryngeal status, vocal fold function, and voice function will be followed      individually with an advanced battery of examinations performed before and up to 1 year      postoperatively. Side effects and complications are noted and reported during surgery and      following surgery at regular intervals during at least 1 year Since spring 2015 no new      patients have been recruited and no treatments are given during 2016 or 2017. The monitoring      authority was changed from Swedish National Board of Health to Swedish Medical Product Agency      (MPA) in March/April 2016.

","      Kidney transplantation is a good treatment option for people with kidney disease. However,      there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it      functioning for a long time. Transplant recipients receive induction therapy and      immunosuppression (anti-rejection) drugs to prevent their body from rejecting the new kidney.      These drugs are used to prevent the immune system from attacking the transplanted kidney.      This research study will evaluate the safety and activity of mesenchymal stromal stem cells      (MSCs) infusion compared to saline-only infusion in reducing the immune suppression necessary      to achieve optimal renal function in renal transplant recipients. All participants will      receive routine care: basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids.    ","      The study is a double-blind, randomized, controlled, dose-escalation and safety study of the      investigational product, autologous MSCs, to be assessed for inducing immune suppression in      living donor kidney transplant recipients as compared to saline, the placebo infusion. The      investigator will obtain exploratory immune response markers to estimate the effect of      autologous MSCs on the T- and B-cell response following living donor kidney transplantation.      The usual routine care supportive drugs will be given to all: corticosteroids during      induction, the calcineurin inhibitor tacrolimus (Prograf®, Astellas Pharma), and      mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept®, Genentech) for maintenance therapy. All subjects will      receive basiliximab (Simulect®, Novartis), a standard drug used to induce immune suppression.      Up to 24 patients will be enrolled at the Houston Methodist Hospital. Safety analyses will be      conducted after the first 4 subjects have been enrolled and completed the first 30-90 days      posttransplant, with subject 2 enrolled 30 days after subject 1 and subject 3 enrolled 30      days after subject 2 (eg, a 30-day window between subject enrollment days). If no safety      signal has been detected, the next group of 4 subjects will be enrolled using no less than a      2-week enrollment window from subject 5, 2 weeks from subject 6, and so on. Subjects will be      evaluated in the same manner until 8 subjects in the final dosing group have completed 90      days or a decision to stop the study has occurred, whichever comes first. Each subsequent      dosing group will begin with a 30-day window of evaluation between subjects enrolled for the      first 4 subjects enrolled in the group. If no adverse safety signal has been detected in the      first 4 cases in that dosing group, the next 4 subjects enrolled will have a 2-week      evaluation window between enrollments. This early evaluation approach will allow for the      assessment of the inflammatory period occurring after transplantation. A final safety review      will occur at the end of the study and a report will be written.      The study will provide information needed to select a MSC dose level to be used in subsequent      clinical trials and to inform the design of subsequent trials.    ",,"

","      The prevalence of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per      100,000 population. The estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per      year. Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the      difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients      with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will      develop MSA.      There are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The      current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are      considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and      transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic      potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of      MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based      therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by      providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been      shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a      means of administering therapeutic agents.      The subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus      clinical criteria for MSA. There will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5      subjects each.      Group 1 will receives MSC-Adipose Autologous with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally.      Group 2 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x 50 million cells      intratechally.      Group 3 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x50 million cells      intratechally and 2x10cc secretome MSC from Adipose Intravenously.      Clinical improvement will be evaluated using the UMSARS scale, PET-Scans, MRI, DaTScan,      IGF-1, BDNF, Sympathetic skin respons (SSR), EMG, Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS),      High definition-Optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), ERG, VEP, Log MAR chart, Ishihara test      and side adverse effect on MSC.      This study is divided into six timeframes : Before an implantation, First Month after second      implantation, Third month after secondary implantation, Sixth month after second      implantation, Ninth month after second implantation and Twelve month after second      implantation. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to      assess clinical improvement within the subjects.    ",,,"

","      Islet transplantation is a promising treatment of type 1 diabetes in selected cases. Results      are however hampered by a relatively low number of islets surviving the transplantation into      the liver, which currently is the site for transplantation. In the present study we compare a      new transplantation site (intramuscular in the arm) to the golden standard (the liver) in      patients undergoing kidney transplantation from the same donor. In half of the intramuscular      transplanted patients, the islets will be mixed with mesenchymal stemcells from the recipient      to, possibly, improve the immunological aspects of the transplantation.

","      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intrathecal treatment      delivered to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of mesenchymal stem cells in ALS patients every 3      months for a total of 4 injections over 12 months.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown into a number of      different kinds of cells. In this study, MSCs will be taken from the subject's body fat and      grown. CSF is the fluid surrounding the spine.      The use of mesenchymal stem cells is considered investigational, which means it has not been      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use. However, the FDA      has allowed the use of mesenchymal stem cells in this research study.    ","      The Goal of the Proposed Study is to perform an open label, 60 subject, Phase II multi-site      clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal treatment of aaMSCs in      ALS. Patients will be treated with 10-100 million aaMSCs every 3 months for a total of 4      intrathecal injections over 12 months. Reduced dose treatments will be allowed based on      specific adverse events. Multiple biomarkers will be tracked throughout the clinical trial      and correlated with response to treatment. This study was initially performed at Mayo Clinic      in Rochester and subsequently expanded to the two other Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona and      Florida. All biopsies and stem cell injections take place at Mayo Clinic Rochester,      regardless of where the subject initially enrolls into the study.    ",,"

","      This study is a prospective, phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and      feasibility of intradiscally injected AD-MSCs in the treatment of painful degenerative disc      disease. The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each      comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each      cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12      subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments      and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial.      Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin      treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical      examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical      assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures      (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.

All injections will be      performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated      immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse      events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be      followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation,      radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis.

Effectiveness of MSCs is due to the following:        -  the ability of MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of stress urinary           incontinence (SUI) in animals (female rats).      After gynecological examination, diagnosis of SUI, MSCs were isolated from adipose tissue,      cultured and then transplanted back to directly under mucosa of urethra by three point      injection in one third distal from the urethral neck at 3, 6 and 9 o'clock and to the      paraurethral area.      Injected volume was 3 ml per patient. For injection MSCs (6*10^6 cells) were mixed with      collagen solution (3,5% w|w).      Follow up patients monitoring was mperformed at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months after injection.    ",,"

",      The study seeks to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose-derived mesenchymal      stromal cells to treat symptoms of mild to severe knee osteoarthritis.    ,"      Interventions to alter the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee are elusive and      joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The      Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal      stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far,      the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators'      pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the      investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat      patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate      the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded      AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic      mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion      criteria.    ",,"

",      This is a phase I / II for the evaluation of the safety and feasibility of intravenous      infusion of mesenchymal cells from autologous bone marrow in patients with Multiple      Sclerosis.      Intravenous administration of autologous mesenchymal cells of bone marrow is feasible and      safe and can be effective in treating patients suffering from multiple sclerosis.    ,"      The study population will consist of a total of 30 patients diagnosed with multiple      sclerosis, who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion set and express their      agreement to participate in the study by signing the informed consent of those whose results      can be clinically evaluable.      Selected patients who consent will be enrolled in the trial and randomized to one of the      following groups:        -  Group 1 receiving a single intravenous administration of cellular product on Day 0 and           placebo infusion on day + 180.        -  Group 2 receiving a placebo infusion on day 0 and a single cell product administration           on day +180.      Randomization will be 1:1, so that 15 patients will receive the cellular product on Day 0      (Group 1) and 15 patients on day +180 (group 2), always maintaining at all times the      double-blind status of the test (patients and researchers).      The bone marrow will be extract from all patients immediately after inclusion in the study,      under local anesthesia with sedation. For patients in group 1 autologous mesenchymal cells      will be obtained from the bone marrow and infuse immediately after the time necessary for      their production. For patients in group 2, bone marrow cells will be frozen for later      procedure of mesenchymal cells and their infusion after six months.      Patients will be evaluated by clinical, radiological, and electrophysiological as well as      detailed in section 8 corresponding to Development Test and Evaluation of Response.      It is estimated that the inclusion period is approximately 12-18 months, and each patient      tracking another twelve months. Therefore the total duration of the study will be about 24 to      30 months from the inclusion of the first patient to completion follow-up period of the last      patient included.      Study objectives:        -  Main objectives: 1. To evaluate the safety of intravenous infusion of autologous bone           marrow mesenchymal cells in multiple sclerosis patients diagnosed by evaluating           complications and adverse effects of the therapy itself and study procedures.           2. Assessing the difference in the number of lesions on magnetic resonance image with           gadolinium, between the groups undergoing treatment at weeks 4, 12 and 24.        -  Secondary objectives: 1.

Change in sensory and motor function following completion of treatment as measured by Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs)
baseline, up to 12 months post injection
Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs) are electrical responses recorded from the nervous system following electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve. For example, stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist produces electrical activity that travels along the sensory pathway on its way to the brain. This activity can be recorded with electrodes positioned along that pathway.

up to 24 months post injection
Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS) The NBSS was designed as an objective and validated way to assess bladder symptoms in patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction as a result of spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and spinal bifida. The NBSS consists of 24 questions. The first question classifies patients by bladder management, but does not make up part of the numeric score. The remaining questions address 3 domains: incontinence, storage and voiding, and consequences. The final question is an overall quality of life question. The total score can range from 0 (no symptoms at all) to 74 (maximum symptoms).

The Adult Neurogenic Bowel Dysfunction Score¹, also known as the Adult NBD score has been designed to help healthcare professionals evaluate the effectiveness of their patient's current bowel management routine by assessing the impact it has on the patient's quality of life. By having your patients answer 10 simple questions, the Adult NBD Score can help identify and quantify severity of bowel dysfunction in the adult patients. The Adult NBD score consists of 10 questions and is a symptom-score where each symptom is weighted based on its impact on quality of life. The scores from each question are added together and a total score is calculated. The maximum score is 47 while minimum is 0.

",      Treatment of patients with trophic ulcers using injection of autologous adipose-derived      mesenchymal stem cells around and inside the wound    ,"      During the implementation of the project, it was planned to develop a method for the      treatment of trophic ulcers using injection of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem      cells in the wound. The positive outlook for the effectiveness of MSCs is due to the      following:        -  the ability of MSCs to stimulate tissue regeneration        -  positive results of preclinical studies of the method of treatment of trophic ulcers in           animals (rats).      In study were included 18 patients (28 trophic ulcers treated). MSCs will be isolated from      adipose tissue, cultured and then transplanted back to the wound. From 1 to 10 million MSCs      in 4 ml were injected depending on the area of the wound. Follow up patients monitoring will      occur at 1，2 and 3, 6, 12, 22 months after injection.    ",,"

","      All procedures are carried out after obtaining informed written consent from patients. Bone      marrow is aspirated from the iliac crest (hip bone) of patients with osteochondral defects      intraoperatively under complete sterile, aseptic conditions and under proper anaesthesia      (general, local). The bone marrow aspirate is placed in tubes and transferred under aseptic      conditions to the Tissue Culture Unit in the Biochemistry Department at the Cairo University      School of Medicine where it is processed and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are isolated      and grown in culture for 2-3 weeks. After this time interval, the cells are reprocessed and      the cell pellet is obtained. Implantation of the cell pellet into the osteochondral defect of      the joint after embedding it on a proper scaffold is performed followed by subsequent defect      coverage with an autologous periosteal flap obtained from the proximal tibia to seal the      defect and maintain the cell pellet in place. The patients will be assessed clinically with      scoring systems preoperatively as well as 6 and 12 months postoperatively to assess relief of      symptoms and joint function. Radiological assessment (X-rays and MRIs)of the affected joints      will be performed at the same time points aforementioned to assess integrity of the formed      cartilage. Second look arthroscopy and biopsy will also be performed to histologically assess      the repair tissue and grade it via arthroscopic grading system according to the International      Cartilage Repair Society guidelines.

",      The purpose of this study is to show safety and feasibility to administer patients own      mesenchymal stem cells to show signs of repair of emphysematous lung tissue    ,"      Study Rationale Emphysema is one of the two main components of chronic obstructive pulmonary      disease (COPD) and contributes over many years to airway obstruction by the loss of elastic      recoil around the smallest airways. Emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking and it is      widely accepted that the disease is caused by excessive proteolytic activity by proteases and      a chronic inflammatory process, characterized by a cellular influx consisting of macrophages,      neutrophils and T cells. This inflammatory response is steroid resistant and leads to slow      but persistent alveolar destruction, resulting in enlarged lungs with bullous parts in both      lungs. In addition to a central role of innate immunity, recent studies suggest that also      (auto)antigen specific immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD.      Currently, the only treatment available for severe emphysema is lung volume reduction surgery      (LVRS) to remove the most destroyed parts of the lungs. The surgery is generally performed in      two separate sessions with a 10-12 weeks interval, with each lung as a separate surgical      target. This surgical treatment allows improved ventilation in the remaining less affected      areas of the lungs as demonstrated by post-surgical clinical improvement of lung function and      increased survival in a subgroup of patients. Delayed wound healing after LVRS is an      important clinical problem. It may lead to prolonged hospital stay due to air leakage from      the lungs into the thoracic cavity. Lung emphysema patients are at high risk for prolonged      air leakage after this surgery, which is most likely explained by the inflammatory process      related to the disease.      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into several      cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocyte progenitors. In      recent years it has become evident that bone-marrow derived MSC (BM-MSC) have potent      immunomodulatory effects on T and B cells and in animal models of chronic inflammation in      vivo. In addition, it has been shown that MSC express or release a variety of soluble factors      implicated in anti-apoptotic signaling and cell growth. Importantly, encouraging results have      recently been obtained with the treatment of severe steroid resistant Graft versus Host      Disease (GvHD) with donor (allogeneic) BM-MSC. Furthermore, in our institute autologous      BM-MSC are currently under investigation for treatment of tissue injury due to autoimmune      disease (Crohn's Disease) and allogeneic immune responses (renal transplant recipients with      biopsy proven subclinical rejection). The combination of the immunosuppressive,      growth-potentiating and anti-apoptotic properties of BM-MSC may lead to accelerated wound      healing after LVRS and might induce lung repair. In the present phase I study the      investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous (i.v.) administration of      BM-MSC prior to LVRS in a small group of severe pulmonary emphysema patients. Results of this      safety and feasibility study may lead to future studies on the use of BM-MSC for      immunomodulation and induction of repair in patients with pulmonary emphysema and milder      stages of COPD.      Objective To test the safety and feasibility of intravenous administration of autologous      BM-MSC after one-sided LVRS and prior to a second LVRS procedure for patients with severe      pulmonary emphysema.      Study design Open label, non-randomized, non-blinded, prospective clinical trial. Patients      are operated in two sessions; initially on one lung without pre-surgical infusion of BM-MSC,      followed by a second surgical procedure on the contralateral lung which is preceded by two      i.v. infusions of BM-MSC one week apart, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the lung surgery.      Study population Patients of at least 40 years of age with end-stage emphysema who are      eligible for lung volume reduction surgery.      Intervention The intervention consists of two doses of BM-MSC infusions in 10 patients with a      one week interval, 4 and 3 weeks prior to the second LVRS respectively.      Study endpoints      Primary endpoint:      1. Safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion of two doses of BM-MSC with 1 wk interval      after the first LVRS and prior to a second LVRS. Toxicity criteria will be evaluated by grade      according to WHO.      Secondary endpoint:        1. Difference in days between post-surgical transpleural air leak of the lung in each           patient after the first (no infusion of BM-MSC) and second surgical (3 weeks after the           last i.v. infusion of BM-MSC) intervention.        2. Histological responses in resected lung tissue (measured by immunohistochemistry of           markers of inflammation, fibrosis and repair).    ",,"

",      The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose-derived      mesenchymal cells for treating confirmed or suspected patients with SARS-CoV-2 and      compromised respiratory function requiring hospitalization.      The hypothesis of the Study is autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal cells given IV to      eligible patients will improve clinical outcomes of COVID 19 positive patients with severe      pneumonia or ARDS by reducing or avoiding cytokine storm.    ,"      While most patients with SARS-CoV-2 present with mild respiratory disease with the most      common symptoms of fever and cough, approximately 14 % progress to severe pneumonia and ARDS.      The overall mortality rate is 2% but varies by country and age of the patient.      In COVID-19 ARDS standard supportive care and treatment for underlying illnesses remain the      mainstay with limited success.      Numerous antiviral medications including remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir or      lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon Beta-1a are in clinical trials but safety and efficacy      remain unclear.      Inflammation associated with a cytokine storm begins at a local site and spreads throughout      the body via systemic circulation. The lungs and other organs are damaged with progressive      inflammation.      Mesenchymal cells offer the potential to treat viral infection both directly and through      reducing the immune response. MSCs play a role as an immunomodulator, which is safe and      effective as demonstrated in numerous clinical trials.      Mesenchymal cells are a potential privileged cell-based therapy in SARS-CoV-2. MSCs derived      extracellular vesicles have demonstrated comparable and sometimes more effective effects in      ameliorating lung inflammation and injury.    ",,"

Prognosis is invariably fatal within 3-5 years since manifestation of the      disease. Despite improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying ALS, the treatment      remains essentially only supportive and focused on symptoms relief. Over the past few years,      stem cell research has expanded greatly as a tool for developing new therapies to treat      incurable diseases.

","      ORTHOUNION is a multi-centre, open, comparative, randomized, clinical trial with three      parallel arms that aims to compare the efficacy of three treatments to enhance bone healing      in patients with long bone non-union.    ","      Bone injuries represent an important world medical problem producing significant healthcare      and societal expenditure. While most bone injuries are not severe and are capable of healing      through bone regeneration by natural callus formation with standard treatments, severe bone      injuries may not heal, becoming an important unmet clinical need.      Non-unions, or pseudarthrosis, may occur in 5% to 20% of long-bone fractures that fail to      heal properly after more than 6 months, with morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and      increased expenses. The most commonly accepted standard augmentation to procure fracture and      non-union healing consists of autologous bone grafting, obtained from the same patient in a      different surgical site and transplanted to the reconstruction site. However, autologous bone      grafting has some drawbacks (such as persistent pain, scar, late recovery, limited amount of      bone, etc) and a limited regeneration efficacy (success rate of about 74%) and high societal      cost. Culture-expanded autologous MSCs combined with biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP)      biomaterial granules have been claimed as a solid regenerative medicine alternative to      autologous bone grafting in non-unions, although current data are limited. In this context,      the ORTHOUNION initiative focuses on the opportunity to test the hypothesis of superiority of      MSC, the investigational ATMP, versus the currently accepted standard therapy, iliac crest      bone autograft to biologically augment surgical treatment of long-bone non-unions.

","      The purpose of this study is to determine if mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from the      fat tissue can be safely administered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with      spinal cord injury. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) have been used in      previous research studies at the Mayo Clinic. All subjects enrolled in this study will      receive AD-MSC treatment, which is still experimental and is not approved by the U.S. Food      and Drug Administration (FDA) for large scale use.

SAE is defined as adverse events that result in death, life threatening adverse experiences, hospitalization, new or prolonged disability/incapacity.
, 
Change in sensory and motor function following completion of treatment as measured by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS)
baseline, 96 weeks
The ASIA Impairment Scale describes a person's functional impairment (both motor and sensory) as a result of their spinal cord injury. The scale has 5 levels, ranging from A (complete) to E (normal).
, 
Change in sensory and motor function following completion of treatment as measured by motor evoked potentials (MEP)
baseline, 96 weeks post-treatment
Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP) are electrical responses recorded either from muscles, or from axons of the descending motor tract, in response to electrical or magnetic stimulation of nervous system structures that govern movement. While there are many different methods for stimulation and recording, the most common approach involves transcranial electrical stimulation of the motor pathway, using subdermal needle electrodes positioned in the scalp above primary motor cortex.
, 
Change in sensory and motor function following completion of treatment as measured by Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs)
baseline, 96 weeks post-treatment
Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (SSEPs) are electrical responses recorded from the nervous system following electrical stimulation of a peripheral nerve. For example, stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist produces electrical activity that travels along the sensory pathway on its way to the brain. This activity can be recorded with electrodes positioned along that pathway.
, 
Number of subjects who develop a new pathologic mass at the spinal cord area of injection or anywhere along the spinal cord.
approximately 96 weeks post-treatment
Patients will undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the spine and the spinal cord with and without contrast.
, 
Change in number of red blood cells following treatment
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Blood will be drawn in order to monitor for markers of systemic inflammation. The normal range of red blood cells varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 10^12 cells per liter.
, 
Change in white blood cells with differential following treatment
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - Automated white cell differential. A machine generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells, usually split into granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
, 
Change in number of platelets following treatment
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test: Platelets are not complete cells, but actually fragments of cytoplasm from a cell found in the bone marrow called a megakaryocyte. Platelets play a vital role in blood clotting. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is in the range of 150,000 - 400,000/ cmm (150 - 400 x 10^9/liter).
, 
Change in Serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test: C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. C-reactive protein is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/dL.
, 
Change in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test, and is a non-specific measure of inflammation. The normal range is 0-22 mm/hr for men and 0-29 mm/hr for women.
, 
Change in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of the body in the urine. A BUN test is done to see how well the kidneys are working. Results of the blood urea nitrogen test are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).
, 
Change in Creatinine
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, so blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. Results are reported in mg/dL.
, 
Change in Sodium
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A sodium blood test allows the doctor to see how much sodium is in the subject's blood. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. A normal sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) of sodium.
, 
Change in Potassium
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliEquivalents per liter (mEq/L).
, 
Change in Chloride
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal blood reference range of chloride for adults in most labs is 96 to 106 milliequivalents (mEq) per liter.
, 
Change in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Inflamed or injured liver cells leak higher than normal amounts of certain chemicals, including liver enzymes, into the bloodstream, which can result in elevated liver enzymes on blood tests. The reference range for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is as follows: Males: 6-34 IU/L, Females: 8-40 IU/L.
, 
Change in Glucose
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. For a subject without diabetes, a fasting blood sugar on awakening should be under 100 mg/dl.
, 
Change in Carbon Dioxide
baseline, 4 weeks post-treatment
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal range for carbon dioxide is 23 to 29 mEq/L (milliequivalent units per liter of blood).

","      The aim of the study is to compare the clinical effects of treatment of knee osteoarthritis      using adipose tissue mesenchymal stromal cells obtained by an enzymatic method with the      outcomes of the therapy with the mechanically fragmented adipose tissue. Identification and      functional analysis of the regenerative capacity of MSCs derived from the adipose tissue      depending on three variables (body weight, sex and age) will help to develop a targeted      therapy for different groups of patients and will determine the effectiveness of both methods      of treatment. An attempt was made to identify the groups of patients with the greatest      regeneration potential of the adipose tissue, and thus indicate those with the most probable      improvement of the joint condition.    ","      Based on the calculation of the sample size using power analysis of the test, investigators      plan to include 100 adults with primary knee osteoarthritis in this study. The patients will      undergo lipoaspiration under sterile conditions of the operating theatre, the collected      lipoaspirates will be further processed - enzymatically with the use of collagenase or      mechanically using the Lipogems system. After collection, lipoaspirates will be immediately      transferred to the laboratory of the Department of Regenerative Medicine with a tissue and      cells bank in Warsaw, and the preparations will be administered to the patients' knee joints      in the operating room under ultrasound control.      The Lipogems system is defined as a minimal tissue manipulation system. In contrast, the      administration of preparations produced using an enzymatic method requires advanced actions.      Lipoaspiration will be performed using blind cannulas and vacuum syringes introduced through      the abdominal wall with a three-millimetre incision on the skin after previous injection to      the adipose tissue with modified Klein's solution (500 ml of saline solution, 1 ml of      adrenaline, 40 ml of 2% lignocaine), which makes the collection easier. 10 ml of the      collected adipose tissue will be used to examine the samples after previous gradient drainage      from Klein's solution. Immediately after collection, the samples will be sent to the      laboratory for analysis (cell count testing, culture, phenotype identification, analysis by      flow cytometry).      The patients will be monitored in the hospital outpatient clinic for one year after the      procedure; the control visits will take place: after 2 and 6 weeks, then after 3 and 6 months      and after a year. A physical examination and the assessment using the KOOS questionnaire will      be performed. Before the procedure and after one year, an X-ray and MRI with T-2 Mapping will      be carried out in order to evaluate the condition of the cartilage.    ",,"

A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures.

Adipose tissue was injected into anal fistulas. Characteristics of      adipose tissue mesenchymal stemcells (AT-MSC) was investigated and compared in patients with      fistula that healed after the treatment (responders) to patients who failed to heal      (non-responders)    ,      Injection with allogene or autologous stem cells has been reported to be efficient treatment      of perianal fistulas. An alternative to this treatment could be injection with freshly      collected autologous adipose tissue. In this study 27 patients with cryptoglandular anal      fistulas were treated with freshly collected autologous adipose tissue.A clinical assessment      of the patient prior to inclusion was undertaken and a loose seton placed for at least 6      weeks prior to fat injection. An MRI of the pelvis was performed before inclusion. Fistulas      with secondary tracts and/or cavities were excluded. The operation was performed in one      procedure including liposuction and injection of adipose tissue. A sample of adipose tissue      from all 27 patients was analyzed. AT-MSCs were isolated and characterized using cellular and      molecular analyses. Clinical and MRI-scanning evaluation of fistula healing and evaluation of      ano-rectal function was performed after 6 months. AT-MSCs phenotype was compared between      responders and non-responders with respect to fistula healing. The evaluation of the AT-MSCs      was performed in a blinded manner.    ,,"

",      The goal of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells administration in the individuals with diagnosed      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.    ,"      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders,      affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord.      Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and      central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of      patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to respiratory failure. Numerous      studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the      clinical and pathological features of ALS. The goal of this nonrandomized, open label study      is to investigate the safety and tolerability of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal      stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.      This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic (neuroprotective and paracrine)      effect of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs). All patients      enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to study enrollment. Patients      are recruited for a clinical trial not longer than 1 year from disease diagnosis. Then,      patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving intrathecally one      application of BM-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally three applications      (each administration every two months) of BM-MSCs. Subsequently, autologous bone      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal fluid at the site      of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse events and      exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital capacity      (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be recorded      throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period.

",,      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous      transplantation of Adipose Tissue derived Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patient with      degenerative arthritis.    ,"      degenerative arthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It is estimated that 26.9      million Americans 25 years old or older have clinical degenerative arthritis of some joints,      with a higher percentage of affliction in the older population. Its clinical manifestations      include joint pain and impairment to movement, and surrounding tissues are often affected      with local inflammation. The etiology of degenerative arthritis is not completely understood;      however, injury, age, and genetics have been considered among the risk factors.      Degenerative arthritis is a progressively debilitating disease that affects mostly cartilage,      with associated changes in bone. Cartilage has limited intrinsic healing and regenerative      capacities.      Due to the increasing incidence of degenerative arthritis and the aging population coupled      with inefficient therapeutic choices, novel cartilage repair strategies are in need.      The availability of large quantities of MSCs and their potential for ready chondrogenic      differentiation after prolonged in vitro expansion have made MSCs the most hopeful candidate      progenitor cell source for cartilage tissue engineering.      In the clinical study, mesenchymal stem cells will be isolated from adipose tissue and      cultured, and administered into the cartilage tissue lesion by orthopedic surgery.      It will be stimulate the regeneration of defective cartilage tissue and to improve their      functions.    ",,"

","      Stroke is one of the leading causes of disability in the world, and stem cell -      transplantation provides a promising approach for rehabilitation. The main objective of this      study is to evaluate the efficacy of the intracerebral injection of autologous bone marrow      mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic stroke.    ","      For many stroke survivors, the best hope is a lengthy program of rehabilitation, followed by      a life-long process of clinical support. However, even with rehabilitation therapy, 50% to      95% of stroke survivors remain impaired. There is thus a great need for new therapeutic      developments for patients with disability after stroke, which is largely unexplored.      Regenerative cell-based therapies offer long-term hope for many patients with stroke, as stem      cells might be possible for dead or injured neural cells to be replaced after acute stroke.      In this study, the investigators will assess the safety and feasibility of intracerebral      transplantation of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients with chronic      stroke. The neurological outcome will be determined after transplantation.    ",,"

","      This trial pretends to validate for clinical use a bioengineered product composed of MSV      cells (mesenchymal stem cells produced by IBGM, Valladolid, which have already been approved      by the Spanish Regulatory Agency for three previous clinical trials) and a cross-linked      matrix of autologous plasma patented by The Blood and Tissue Bank of Asturias (WO2008/      119855) for bone maxillary cysts refilling. These two groups collaborate in the present      project with the team of Maxillofacial Surgery of the Hospital Universitario del Río Hortega,      who leads the clinical trial and deals with the medical aspects. The proposed trial is based      on positive results obtained in previous animal studies performed by the present      multidisciplinary team. The investigators propose a phase I / II clinical trial with 10      patients suffering from bone cysts in the maxillofacial region. Autologous mesenchymal stem      cells isolated from a bone marrow sample will be seeded in the autologous plasma matrix and      cultivated for 3 weeks. At this time, the cyst will be removed by surgery and the cavity      filled with the protein matrix containing the mesenchymal cells. Checks will be conducted at      3 weeks, 3 and 6 months following the evolution of the cavity by panoramic radiography and      computerized tomography scan.    ","      The objective of this project is to provide a competitive clinical solution with an      autologous product, a balanced cost and the possibility of extending use to other      pathologies.      This protocol includes treatment of 10 patients with cystic disease of the jaws that meet all      the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.      For autologous cell preparation a sample of spongy bone from the maxillary tuberosity and 20      ml of serum are obtained from the patient in order to prepare the crosslinked protein matrix      and the MSV-H cells. Cells are selected and expanded under GMP conditions according to the      methodology used in previous trials (EudraCT 2005-005498-36, 2008-001191-68 and      2009-0170450-11 ). MSV-H cells are obtained directly from biopsy culture jawbone of the      patient by cultivation techniques ""in vitro"" and differentiate for 21 days once conveyed in      the matrix with osteogenic differentiation medium of the following composition: DMEM, 10%      FBS, 1% P / E, 0.1 mM dexamethasone, 50 mM ascorbate 2-phosphate, 10 mM phosphate ßGlicerol.      All differentiation factors have already been approved for clinical use. After the period of      the product differentiation can be implanted to the patient.      The bioimplant is used to refill the bone defects after osteotomy and maxillary cyst      enucleation, with 5-10 million cells per unit of 2 cm in diameter and 0.3 cm thick. The      cavity is closed with the mucoperiosteal flap and sutured with reabsorbable material. The end      point of the trial is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and indications of treatment      efficacy according to both clinical criteria and objective imaging confirming the volumetric      bone regeneration and maintenance over time. For this purposes orthopantomography exploration      will be performed before and 2 and 6 months after intervention.    ",,"

","      This study will test the hypothesis that MSCs in combination with Everolimus facilitate      Tacrolimus withdrawal, reduce fibrosis and decrease the incidence of opportunistic infections      compared to standard tacrolimus dose.    ","      Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage      renal disease. Despite excellent short-term results, long-term survival of transplanted      kidneys has not improved accordingly in the last decades. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) have      been the cornerstone of immunosuppressive therapy for many years, due to their efficacy in      preventing acute rejection. However, CNI have nephrotoxic side effects that can directly      contribute to renal dysfunction and compromise long-term outcomes. Consequently there is a      strong interest in immunosuppressive (IS) regimens that maintain efficacy for the prevention      of acute rejection, whilst reducing nephrotoxicity.      In this perspective the combination of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) with a mTor inhibitor      (Everolimus (Certican®)) might be an optimal strategy to facilitate CNI (tacrolimus)      withdrawal. MSCs have IS properties and roles in tissue repair and everolimus is a      proliferation signal inhibitor with potent immunosuppressant effects. In experimental studies      the combination of mTor inhibitor and MSCs was shown to attenuate alloimmune responses and to      promote allograft tolerance.      In total 70 de novo renal recipients, 18-75 years of ages will be recruited from the      transplant clinics of the LUMC. Thirty five of these patients will be included in the      Certican/ and MSC group and 35 patients in the Certican/ standard dose tacrolimus group.      Patients of the MSC treated groups will receive two doses of autologous BM derived MSCs IV, 7      days apart, 6 and 7 weeks after transplantation in combination with Certican® (1.5 mg      b.i.d.). At the time of the second MSC infusion tacrolimus will be withdrawn in 2 weeks      (after 1 week dose of tacrolimus will be halved, after 2 weeks stopped). Patients in the      control group will receive Certican® (1.5 mg b.i.d.) and standard dose tacrolimus (through      levels 6-8 ng/ml after 6 weeks).      Primary goal is evaluate whether concentration-controlled Certican® with MSCs compared to      Certican® with standard tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients reduces fibrosis by      quantitative Sirius Red scoring.

",      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous      transplantation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) mixed with collagen I scaffold      in patient with Knee cartilage defects and osteoarthritis    ,"      Articular cartilage defects have a weak potential for self-repair because of the reduced      mitotic capacity of chondrocytes in vivo. Because some patients with articular cartilage      defects may progress to osteoarthritis, such defects need to be repaired even though their      exact natural course remains obscure. Traditional methods for repair, such as micro fracture,      perforations, abrasion arthroplasty, have not produced consistent satisfactory long term      clinical results. Transplantation of autologous bone marrow MSCs expanded in culture would be      a promising approach in the repair of articular cartilage defects in human osteoarthritic      knees. This method is clinically straightforward to perform because autologous cells can be      readily harvested and expanded in culture without losing their capacity to differentiate into      chondrocytes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical results obtained with      autologous MSCs expanded in culture for the treatment of full-thickness chondral defects in      human knee.    ",,"

","      This study will evaluate the efficacy of biologic augmentation of ACL reconstruction with      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells as measured by magnetic resonance imaging to      detect graft healing and integration. Secondary endpoints will include validated patient      reported outcome measures, as well as functional outcome using objective examination      findings.    ","      Introduction      Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears are a common and devastating injury among young      athletes, and re-injury poses significant threats to both successful return to play and long      term outcomes. Graft healing during ACL reconstruction (ACLR) is a slow biologic process,      that involves graft incorporation into bone tunnel sites, as well as intra-articular graft      remodeling . The intra-articular graft remodeling process is known as ligamentization, and      occurs in three phases after ACLR. The first phase of early healing occurs between 0 and      three months, the second phase occurs between 6 months and one year, and the final phase of      maturation occurs after 1 year when the graft appears very similar to the native ACL. The      studies that defined these time points biopsied human bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) ACL      autografts at different postoperative points, and described changes occurring over time in      regards to vascularization, cellular aspects, and appearance of the extracellular matrix in      comparison to control ACLs . Unlike animal models which display a necrotic stage, grafts in      human models undergo an early vascular invasion, associated with fibroblasts that are      converted to a hyper-cellular matrix with only focalized areas of necrosis . This process      occurs as early as 3 weeks postoperatively, and increases over time as areas similar to the      native patellar tendon with mature collagen and metabolically quiescent cells decrease . This      process is the limiting factor in graft healing for bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) grafts, as      osteointegration occurs earlier .      The processes of osteointegration and ligamentization are responses to the new intrasynovial      milieu and physical forces that the new graft is exposed to. During these healing and      restructuring processes, failure load and stiffness of grafts decreases by up to 24% at 7      weeks, before strengthening to their potential . This contributes to the long recovery period      for ACLR, and the risk of re-rupture during this period. Advances in biologic adjuncts to      accelerate and improve this healing process would have a significant impact on the management      of ACL injuries.      Recently, biologic preparations of various growth factors have been developed to safely and      effectively treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including tendinopathies and      arthritis . Bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) consists of undifferentiated mesenchymal      stem cells that are concentrated and applied to the injury site . Previous studies have      demonstrated this treatment to offer the pluripotent potential of the cells to impact      healing, regeneration, biomechanical strength, and reducing bone-tunnel enlargement .      Investigators have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cell reinforced grafts had a      significantly higher failure load and stiffness as early as 8 week post-operation in a rabbit      model, suggesting an added benefit of advanced healing . Using BMSCs can offer a novel method      to enhance tendon graft osteointegration. While there have been numerous laboratory studies      researching the effect of mesenchymal stem cells, there lacks evidence in translation to the      clinical setting. Silva et al performed a study where they injected bone marrow derived stem      cells (BMSCs) into patellar tendon grafts to examine for increased graft-to-bone tunnel      integration. They did not find a significant difference of tunnel integration on MRI imaging,      but they did not examine the intra-articular portions for the effect on the ligamentization      process, nor did they examine the effect on clinical examination and patient reported      outcomes .      Quantitative MRI is a non-invasive method to interrogate tissue properties and evaluate the      biochemical composition of tissues. The T2* sequence gives information regarding tissue graft      volume, water content, fiber alignment, and tissue density. Median grayscale values (a      measure to determine tissue quality)can also be correlated to maximum failure load, yield      load, and linear stiffness of grafts in a porcine model. Increases in MRI signals in ACL      grafts have been found to be time dependent, becoming well established by three months,      particularly at the distal intra-articular portion near the tibial tunnel . These changes      have not been shown previously to be predictive of graft failure, but Investigators have      recently also confirmed that normalized T2* signal intensity values of ACL grafts have      significant correlation with knee instability related to ligamentization and tunnel healing.      A recent study examined intra-articular graft maturation after platelet-rich plasma gel      (PRPG) application, with MRI at month intervals from 3-12 months postoperatively. The      intra-articular segment was divided in a proximal, middle, and distal segment, on a scale      from 0-3 ranging from completely homogenous to severely heterogeneous. The mean time to      obtain completely homogenous bone-patella tendon-bone (BTB) graft was 109 days for the PRPG      group, and 363 for the control group 8.      We propose using quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T2* mapping to investigate      if BMAC treatment at time of ACL reconstruction can accelerate the graft maturation and      healing process. We will perform a randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing ACL      reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone allograft evaluating the T2* weighted MRI      changes of the graft at 3 and 9 months after surgical reconstruction. Additionally, we will      obtain patient-reported outcome measures from this cohort to evaluate if BMAC treatment      imparts a clinically-significant effect on ACL reconstruction.      Study Rationale      This study will evaluate the efficacy of biologic augmentation of ACL reconstruction with      BMSCs as measured by magnetic resonance imaging to detect graft healing and integration.      Secondary endpoints will include validated patient reported outcome measures, as well as      functional outcome using objective examination findings.      Hypothesis      The hypotheses of this study are that there will be improved graft healing and integration at      three and nine months as measured by decreased signal intensity and heterogeneity on T2* MRI      following administration of BMAC during ACL reconstruction compared to the control group.      Additionally, patient reported outcomes and physical examination findings will be      significantly improved at an earlier time in those who receive the BMAC treatment to their      allograft compared to the control group.      Study Plan      This study will be a prospective randomized trial of patients undergoing arthroscopic      reconstruction of full thickness anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. All patients who      sign consent and undergo full thickness ACL reconstruction will be enrolled in the study.      Enrollment will continue until 32 patients, 16 in each group, are enrolled. Follow-up will      take place at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, and 24 months.    ",,"

","      Systemically healthy volunteers with no active periodontal disease are recruited from      referrals to the Dept. of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Biology of Implants,      Aristotle Univ of Thessaloniki for implant therapy. After signing a consent form,      participants will be randomized into two treatment groups. Group-A (NA=10) will receive      crestal placement of implants following a two-stage protocol in combination with a biocomplex      comprising autologous alveolar bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived      reagents, produced in clean room facilities and seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with      autologous fibrin glue. In Group-B (NB=10) implants are placed on the alveolar crest      following a two-stage protocol and the manufacturer's guidelines. Intra-surgical clinical and      radiographic assessments are performed at the time of implant placement (T0) and at the      two-stage surgery (T1). Changes in mucosa thickness, width of keratinized tissues, marginal      bone and bone thickness at the surgical site will be determined at T0-T1. Groups will be      further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical site at T0      [thin mucosa (≤2.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (>2.5mm) for Groups-AII/-BII]. A linear      mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine changes in the      dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two stage-implants placed either      conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex.    ","      Aims & Objectives:      The present study describes a novel method to preserve the crestal bone at two-stage dental      implants using autologous aBMMSCs, free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room      facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded into commercially available      collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece) that are stabilized over the implant platform upon      surgical implant placement.      Primary objective:      This study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel method based on histotechnology in crestal      bone preservation at two-stage dental implants, as compared to conventional surgical implant      placement following the manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting      materials.      Secondary, changes in the peri-implant soft tissues will be also determined between implant      placement and exposure and will be compared between the experimental and the conventional      surgical treatment approaches.      Study design:      Biopsies will be derived from alveolar bone marrow of the alveolar bone under local      anaesthesia in each patient belonging to the Experimental Group (Group-A). Briefly, after a      thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill      will be performed in the alveolar bone of an intraoral edentulous site other than the implant      site and a 2x8 mm or 3cc approximately of an osseous core will be harvested. The area and the      biopsy will be copiously irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to      achieve primary closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in      sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece      (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict      clinical grade expansion protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013; Bakopoulou et al. in preparation).      Since MSCs will be isolated and expanded in vitro in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)-compliant      clean rooms (Biohellenika facilities) meeting the quality guidelines set by the European      Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for autologous      transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy applications.      In Biohellenika facilities, 40ml of venous blood will be collected from each subject in      Group-A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the isolation      and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin glue will      be used to load the BM-MSCs onto a commercially available collagen fleece. At the day of the      surgical placement of the implants and chairside, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched      with fibrin glue) will be delivered in an insulin syringe containing 10x10E6 cells/200μl      fibrin and will be gently loaded onto the collagen fleece and activated with the addition of      CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex will be sutured onto the lingual flap using bioresorbable      sutures (5-0 Coated VicrylTM (polyglactin 910), reverse cutting 3/8 circle - 16mm, Ethicon,      Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA) and will be thus gently stabilized over the      implant platform head partially covering the buccal bone. Handling of the scaffold will be      done with care to avoid doing any harm to the viable cells.      In the Control Group (Group-B), the implants will be placed crestally following the      manufacturer's guidelines with no adjunctive use of grafting materials. One system of      implants will be consistently used throughout the study in both groups (Osseotite, Certain,      parallel wall, Biomet 3i, Palm Beach Gardens, USA).      Post-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end      of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for 5 days)      will be prescribed to both Groups. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12% chlorhexidine      twice daily and avoid brushing and chewing hard in the treated area for two weeks. During      this 2-week period, patients will be followed on a weekly basis to record uneventful healing,      and after that patients will discontinue rinsing with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral      hygiene. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three to four months to have their implants      exposed.      Subjects will be assessed at baseline (T0: surgical implant placement) and T1 (implant      exposure at 3-4 months). Clinical recordings will be determined by a single calibrated      examiner using a manual periodontal probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA)      with an endo-stop attached on it and all measurements will be digitalised using an electronic      caliper. A customised metallic caliper will measure the thickness of the bone at the      buccal/lingual aspects of the implant. At T0 and T1, clinical recordings will assess:        1. Thickness of mucosa at the top of the alveolar ridge and 2- and 4mm apically, on the           buccal and the lingual aspects of the ridge.        2. Width of keratinized mucosa buccally and lingually of the implantation site.        3. Thickness of buccal and lingual bone at 0, 3- and 6mm from the implant shoulder.        4. Level of of the buccal and lingual marginal bone, in relation to the implant shoulder.      Standardised digital radiographs will be collected at T0 and T1 to linearly determine changes      (in mm) in the height of the alveolar bone between the implant shoulder and teh alveolar      crest using the VixWin™ Platinum|Gendex software.      Groups will be further divided into two subgroups based on mucosal thickness of the surgical      site at T0 [thin mucosa (≤2.5mm) for Groups-AI/-BI; thick mucosa (>2.5mm) for      Groups-AII/-BII] and all the parameters will be determined and compared on the basis of the      surgical approach and mucosa thickness at the surgical site.      A linear mixed model for repeated measures will be used for data analyses to determine      changes in the dimensions of the peri-implant soft and hard tissues, around two      stage-implants placed either conventionally, or in combination with the biocomplex.

","      Current medication treatments for KOA aim to relieve inflammation and pain, but they do      little to delay or reverse the disease progression and most medications have obvious side      effects. When the conservative treatments are useless to patients and joint deformities and      joint disfunction, the patients may require surgery. Although surgery of the joints can      relieve the pain temporarily, long-term effect (over 10 years) is hard to achieve.    ","      Human adipose-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells (haMPCs) are obtained through a series of      procedures: firstly, the fresh adipose tissue is digested with collagenase, filtered,      centrifuged and then discard mature adipose cells to obtain adipose tissue-derived nuclear      cells also called stromal vascular fraction cells (SVFs). In the end, haMPCs are prepared      after being purified andamplified to P2-P5. When induced by specific factors, haMPCs have a      potential for multilineage differentiation towards bone, cartilage and fat tissue both in      vivo and in vitro. The haMPCs can secrete a number of soluble mediators to stimulate the      proliferation of endogenous progenitor cells, to act as nutrients, to be immunosuppressive,      to be anti-inflammatory, to prevent fibrosis and promote angiogenesis. The cytokines secreted      by haMPCs play a synergic role in restoring the dynamic balance of synthesis and decompositon      of cartilage tissue, and finally to repair the impaired cartilage.

","      Stem cell therapy is an emerging treatment for cardiovascular disease but the best cell type      and delivery method remain to be determined. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated improvement of      cardiac function by Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) therapy in particular by their paracrine and      immunosuppressive properties. Investigators initiated the MESAMI program by the bicentric      pilot phase and highlighted the safety and feasibility of intramyocardial injections of MSCs      from bone marrow in patients with chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular      dysfunction, guide by the NOGA-XP system. The MESAMI program continues with the phase 2,      multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.The aim of this phase 2 study      is to demonstrate a functional improvement, measuring peak VO2, at 3 months between the cell      therapy group and the placebo group.    ","      Ischemic cardiomyopathies are a leading cause of death in both men and women. During the last      decade, treatments for heart failure have evolved, but their purpose is to improve symptoms      and prevent aggravation of the disease. Current research is focusing on the development of      cell-based therapies using different sources of stem cells which can provide trophic and      paracrine support or even replace dying cells with new ones. A specific form of stem cells,      called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. These cells      are known for their ability to secrete paracrine factors and their immunosuppressive      properties. The MESAMI 2 study will evaluate the efficacy of MSCs injection directly into the      heart to repair and restore heart function in people with chronic ischemic heart failure      using NOGA-XP system.      This phase 2 study is a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,      placebo-controlled trial. A total of 90 patients will be randomized in 2 arms to receive      intramyocardial injection of MSCs or placebo. Patients will be followed up for 13 months.      Bone marrow will be collected and immediately transported to the French Blood Establishment      for MSC isolation and expansion. Patients will receive intramyocardial injection of MSCs or      placebo during a left heart catheterization.    ",,"

","      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed      cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily      available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to      survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered      cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the      surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this      may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft      cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a      number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and      neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile      grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac      precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development      in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both      post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and      heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also      been studies clinically.      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority      of the trials.      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and      problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available      to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart      failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important      alternative for this disease.    ",,,"

","      Systemically healthy periodontitis patients are recruited from new referrals to the      Department of Periodontology and Biology of Implants, AUTh. After completion of non-surgical      periodontal treatment those subjects who have at least one interdental osseous defect with      probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level of ≥ 6mm and an intrabony component of ≥      3mm with no endodontic or furcation involvement are randomly allocated into one of the three      treatment groups. Group A receives regenerative treatment using autologous bone marrow      mesenchymal stem cells free of animal derived reagents, produced in clean room facilities and      seeded into collagen scaffolds enriched with fibrin glue; in Group B, a collagen fleece      enriched with fibrin glue devoid of stem cells fills the osseous defect; Group C receives      open flap debridement retaining the soft wall of the defect. Thereafter, subjects are      followed for 12 months and are repeatedly assessed based on clinical, radiographic,      immunological and microbiological parameters.    ","      Aims & Objectives The present study describes a novel method to regenerate periodontal      tissues in periodontal infrabony defects using autologous BM-MSCs, free of animal derived      reagents, produced in clean room facilities enriched with autologous fibrin glue and seeded      into commercially available collagen scaffolds (collagen fleece).      Primary objective This study aims to assess the efficacy of a novel regenerative treatment of      periodontal infrabony defects using a biocomplex of BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/collagen fleece, as      compared to a cell-free grafting substitute of fibrin glue/collagen fleece and to a control      treatment approach of open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of grafting materials.      Secondary Objectives        -  To document the stability of the enhanced treatment outcome and to continue to assess           the safety and effectiveness of BM-MSCs transplantation as compared to the control           treatment of open flap debridement over the study period.        -  Determine the immunological and microbiological profiles of the participants throughout           the study period in an attempt to understand local and systemic effects of the           transplantation of BM-MSCs in chronically diseased sites, such as the infrabony           periodontal defect. In addition, the healing response to treatment will be determined           throughout the observation period (baseline to 12-months).      Study Design      Investigational products aBM-MSCs cultures will be established from osseous biopsies derived      from bone marrow of the alveolar bone in each patient belonging to Group A. Briefly, after a      thorough oral rinse with chlorhexidine 0.12% for 1min, an osteotomy using a trephine drill      will be performed in the alveolar bone and a 2x8 mm osseous core will be harvested. The area      will be irrigated with saline solution and then flaps will be sutured to achieve primary      closure at the donor site. The bone sample will be then immediately placed in sterile tubes      containing HBSS and antibiotics/antimycotics and will be transported to a Good Laboratory      Practice (GLP)-compliant authorized facility meeting the quality guidelines set by the      European Union for the preparation of clinical-grade stem cell cultures for delivery to the      patient. aBM-MSC isolation will be performed using the enzymatic dissociation method, as      previously described (Bakopoulou 2013). For culture expansion, autologous serum obtained from      60ml of venous blood collected from each subject will be used to supplement aMEM cell culture      medium, in order to avoid the use of any animal derived reagents, such as bovine serum. The      osseous biopsy will be immediately processed to ensure high viability of the established      cultures. After expansion for two passages (approximate time needed 16-24 days depending on      cell donor) cells will be harvested for delivery to the patient. For cell dissociation and      passaging, highly purified, GMP compatible recombinant enzymes (Tryple, Thermo Fisher      Scientific) will be used to avoid use of porcine trypsin. At this stage, a sample of 20ml      venous blood will be required for the preparation of the autologous fibrin glue in Group B,      as in Group A initial bloodletting (60ml) will cover the needs of the cell cultures and      fibrin glue preparation. Subsequently, fibrin glue will be loaded with- (Group A) or without-      (Group B) stem cells into a commercially available collagen fleece scaffold directly before      clinical application.      Quality control of the established BM-MSC cultures before clinical application      Before delivery to the patient, all BM-MSCs cultures will be evaluated for:        -  Viability using Trypan Blue exclusion        -  Sterility: cultures will be tested for potential contamination from bacteria, mycoplasma           and endotoxins (LAL test)        -  ""Stemness"" properties based on the minimal criteria established by the International           Society for Cellular Therapy (ISCT) regarding MSCs (Dominici et al 2006).      Note: Methodology on stem cell characterization methods is analytically described in previous      publications by our research group (Bakopoulou et al. 2013).      After application of the BM-MSCs/fibrin glue/CaCl2 mixture into the collagen scaffolds, a      small sample of the biocomplex of randomly selected cases will be separated using surgical      scissors and will be transferred to the lab for further (in parallel to the clinical      application) ex vivo characterization of stem cell behavior in a biomimetic microenvironment.      This will allow correlation between stem cell behavior and the clinical outcome, since      retrieval and analysis of the regenerated tissues directly from the host is not feasible for      ethical reasons.      Preparation of autologous fibrin glue Twenty ml of venous blood will be collected from the      ante-cubital fossa of patients in Groups A and B and blood samples will be immediately      transferred to a falcon tube, which contains anticoagulant. After determination of the      platelet counts the blood sample will be centrifuged (2000rpm, 10min) and plasma will be      separated and stored in another falcon. Platelets counts will be then determined and the      sample will be centrifuged again. PRP (platelet rich plasma containing 1,000,000 plts/ul)      will be then separated from the supernatant PPP (platelet poor plasma) and both preparations      will be further processed following a standard protocol for fibrin glue preparation      (Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece).      Design of the clinical arm of the study      Pre-selection of Subjects Subjects will be recruited from new referrals at the Department of      Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology and Implant Biology; no external advertising or      recruitment will be undertaken. Subjects will be in good general health.      Admission into the Study Before admission into the study, each subject will be informed by      the principal investigator of the nature and risks of the study both orally and in writing      (Subject Information Form) and written informed consent (Subject Informed Consent Signature      Form) will be obtained. Each subject will be given a copy of their duly signed consent form      to maintain for their own records. The subjects' personal demographics and medical history      and study suitability in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria set in the      protocol will be recorded. Subjects may continue any medications not included in the      exclusion criteria; however, these medications should be documented together with any      concurrent medical condition not pre-excluded.      Procedures for Subject Withdrawal or Discontinuation Any subject, who wishes to withdraw from      the study for personal or any other reason, is entitled to do so. However, the reason for the      withdrawal of any subject from the study in addition to whether the reason is related to the      test product will be recorded by the principal investigator. Any participant failing to      attend more than twice is removed from the study. Subjects that experience an adverse event      will be excluded from further participation in the study.      If a subject wishes to withdraw from the study, all efforts will be made to complete and      report the observations as thoroughly as possible up to the date of withdrawal. Subjects will      be asked to consider giving further information as to the reason(s) for the withdrawal. Any      information reported will be recorded.      Expected Duration of each subject participation Each subject is expected to attend nine      visits in total over a period of 12 months; one screening visit, one treatment visit to      receive surgical treatment of the designated area, four follow-up reviews and three      additional visits for clinical and radiographic reassessment and sample collection (whole      saliva, gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), subgingival plaque).      Investigators' calibration and randomisation Patients will be screened for eligibility by one      examiner and will be enrolled one at a time on a continuous basis after obtaining a code      number. A trial contributor not involved in data collection will perform the randomisation      and announce the treatment modality to the therapist using telephone communication. Clinical      assessments will be carried out by a single examiner who will have no access to previous      recordings and is not otherwise involved in other clinical procedures. An investigator      calibration exercise will be performed to obtain acceptable intra-examiner reproducibility      for PPD, CAL, and evaluation of defect anatomy. Intra-examiner reproducibility will be      evaluated by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman 95% limits of      agreement (Bland and Altman, 1999).      Statistical analysis of experimental data The analysis will be performed using the IBM      Statistics SPSS 20.0, software. Data will be expressed as means +/- standard deviation (SD).      Unbalances between the test and control groups that are generated by the randomisation      procedures will be assessed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and      the Fisher's Exact test or the Chi-Square test for categorical variables. The significance of      the treatment effects on the dependent variables CAL changes, PPD changes and radiographic      changes will be estimated by constructing linear mixed models using the SPSS MIXED procedure.      For all analyses the statistical significance will be set at p<0.05.      Ethical considerations / Authorisations for stem cell cultures Biohellenika, Thessaloniki,      Greece provides state of the art facilities and labs that are operating under the strictest      regulations for stem cells processing and storage. The labs are licensed according to      Government's order 26/24-3-2008 (regulation of Greek law according to European law 2004/23/K      of and Council 31-3-2004 for the establishment prototypes of quality and safety for the      donation, the purchase, the quality controls the cryopreservation, storage and the      distribution of human tissues and cells (EEL 102/7-4-2004) and the related guidelines 2006/17      EK (EEL 38/9/2006) and 2006/86EK (EEL 294/25-10-2006). The license F 6172/17514/1269 is      published in Gov. paper 2589 31/12/2009.      Since November 2014, Biohellenika operates under the new law 3984, published in Gov paper No      150, 2011 after a positive recommendation of the National Transplant Committee to Department      of Health and at the moment the new license is about to published in the Gov paper.      The labs and the procedures are accredited by the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB),      last inspection 30th of September, 2014 and by the National System of Accreditation according      to ISO 15189:2007. Also the labs are certified according to ISO 9001:2008, for processing,      quality control and cryopreservation of autologous cell lineages and ISO 13485:2003 for the      cryopreservation system which is also an international patent of Biohellenika.      Clean rooms operate according to the guidelines of BSR Ingenieur-Buro with ISO 14644-5. The      security levels meet all the standards ISO 27001 and the company is licensed and regulated by      the Data Protection Authority.      The labs are surveyed 24 hours for air quality and equipped with Cryo-View data base System,      ISBT 128 barcoding system, Temperature -Liquid N2 level, Security Alarms and two power      generators.      Study Schedule Clinical design and interventions for autologous transplantation of BM-MSCs      Subjects with severe chronic periodontitis will be scheduled to receive non-surgical      periodontal treatment under local anaesthesia using hand and power driven instruments, in      addition to motivation in periodontal care and thorough oral hygiene instructions. Subjects      will be clinically reassessed six weeks after the completion of non-surgical treatment and      those subjects with remaining periodontal pockets (PPD & CAL ≥ 6mm; infrabony component ≥      3mm) and no overt signs of gingival inflammation will be screened for suitability to      participate in the current study. The screening visit will include an initial full-mouth      periodontal examination, intra-oral radiographic examination and fulfilment of      inclusion/exclusion criteria. In case of suitability, the nature of the study will be      explained in detail to all subjects and a signed consent form approved by the Ethics      Committee of the Dental School, AUTh. will be obtained from each participant. Then, patients      will be randomly allocated into one of the three treatment Groups (-A, -B and -C). A single      defect will be treated in each patient.      Subsequently, an osseous biopsy and blood samples will be collected from the participants of      Group A under strict sterile conditions. Each sample will be then immediately placed in      sterile tubes and will be transported to Biohellenika, Thessaloniki, Greece      (http://www.biohellenika.gr) for stem cell isolation and expansion according to a strict      protocol (Bakopoulou et al. 2013, Bakopoulou et al. in preparation). Since MSCs will be      isolated and expanded in vitro in GLP-class clean rooms meeting the quality guidelines set by      the European Union and no animal derived reagents will be used throughout the experiments for      autologous transplantation, the cells are considered safe for human clinical cell therapy      applications. In Biohellenika facilities 60ml of venous blood will be collected from each      subject in Group A shortly after the biopsy harvest, so that autologous serum is used for the      isolation and culture expansion of the autologous stem cells. In addition, autologous fibrin      glue will be used to load the BM-MSCs onto the collagen fleece. In addition, a blood sample      of 20ml will be collected from subjects in Group B, in order to provide fibrin glue which      will enrich the collagen fleece before surgical placement into the osseous defect. Finally,      subjects in Group C will not be called for bloodletting as the infrabony defects in these      individuals will be surgically managed by open flap debridement with no adjunctive use of      grafting materials.      As part of the GLP quality control, the MSCs will be analysed for sterility and endotoxins      and will be also tested for potential contamination from bacteria (BD BACTEC™), mycoplasma      and endotoxins (LAL test).      Local anaesthesia (1.8ml of 2% lidocaine with 1:80,000 epinephrine; Lignospan special,      Septodont) will be infiltrated in the buccal and lingual aspects of the involved teeth      avoiding the papillae. Then, strictly intra-sulcular incisions will be performed to preserve      the gingival tissues and in particular the interdental papilla associated with the      bone-dental defect (Cortellini, 2012; Cortellini and Tonetti 2007). The defect will be      debrided and the root will be carefully planed with the combined use of Gracey curettes and      power-driven instruments (EMS Piezon®, EMS, Nyon, Switzerland). Care will be taken to retain      the soft-tissue wall of the defects and the osseous defect will be irrigated with saline to      control bleeding.      In Group A, the grafting material (BM-MSCs enriched with fibrin glue) will be delivered in      two insulin syringes each containing 5x10E6 cells/100μl fibrin and will be gently loaded onto      the collagen fleece and polymerized with the addition of CaCl2. Subsequently, the biocomplex      will be gently packed into the defect until complete fill. Handling of the scaffold is done      with care to avoid any destruction of viable cells.      In Group B, the collagen fleece enriched with fibrin glue devoid of viable cells will fill      the vertical bone defect with caution. In Groups -A and -B the delivery of fibrin glue      with/without viable cells will be identical, so that the therapist is blinded to the      procedures.      Group C, patients will receive open flap debridement and root planing of the root surface in      a similar manner as subjects in Groups -A and -B, but there will be no adjunctive use of      grafting materials.      The operator will be blinded to the treatment modality (Groups -A and -B), while in Group C      since no grafting materials will be used, the treatment modality will become obvious to the      operator but this will take place towards the conclusion of the surgery, after the collection      of clinical data. Papilla preservation techniques and minimally invasive surgical techniques      will be sought in all groups, avoiding scoring the periosteum. Flaps will be repositioned and      sutured using a single modified internal mattress suture (5-0 Monosyn, Braun) at the      defect-associated interdental area and similar sutures will be employed to close the flaps in      any other interdental areas. Two weeks post-surgery clinical observation for uneventful      healing or presence of adverse tissue reaction will be performed followed by suture removal.      Post-operative care Post-operative pain will be controlled with Ibuprofen (600mg) at the end      of the surgical procedure and 12h later if in pain. Amoxicillin (500mg / 8 hours for five      days) will be prescribed to all participants. All patients will be instructed to use 0.12%      chlorhexidine twice daily and avoid brushing, flossing and chewing hard in the treated area      for four weeks. During this 4-week period, stringent post-operative supportive program care      will be instituted at bi-weekly intervals, and after that patients will discontinue rinsing      with chlorhexidine solution and resume oral hygiene. Interdental cleaning will commence six      weeks post-surgery for all Groups. Thereafter, subjects will be seen at three, six and 12      months for periodontal supportive care.      Clinical recordings Full-mouth and site-specific periodontal recordings including BOP; Plaque      Index (presence/absence of plaque); PPD and CAL will be determined using a manual periodontal      probe (Hu-Friedy XP-23/QW) to the nearest millimetre at six sites per tooth and parallel to      the long axis at four time-points; baseline, 6-, 9-, 12-months. Clinical measurements at the      designated sites (infrabony defects) will be determined prior to surgery and before      anaesthesia (baseline). Intra-surgical assessments will be carried out once during surgery.      Intra-surgical clinical assessments The defect morphology (one-, two-, three-walls or      combination) will be determined intra-surgically by the number of bone walls associated with      the lesion; The distance between the cemento-enamel junction and the bottom of the defect      (CEJ-BD) will be determined in mm; The distance from the CEJ to the most coronal      interproximal level of the bone crest (CEJ-BC) will be determined in mm; The total defect      depth: the distance between the bone crest and the bottom of the defect (BC-BD) will be      determined in mm; The width of the defect width (horizontal distance between the bone crest      and the root surface) will be determined in mm.      If the CEJ is not detectable due to a cervical restoration the restoration margin (RM) will      serve as reference point for clinical and radiographic measurements.      Radiographic evaluation Intraoral digital radiography will be utilised to determine the bone      regeneration of the infrabony defects at six time points; baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-,      12-months. Standardised periapical digital radiographs (RadioVisioGraphy; Trophy Radiology      S.A., Paris, France) will be obtained using the long-cone paralleling technique. To      standardise the exposure geometry, a customised bite-block of an elastic impression material      will be adjusted on the sensor holder, stored in sealed plastic containers at room      temperature and will be reused during every recall radiographic appointment.      In a similar manner as the intra-surgical assessment, the following anatomical landmarks will      be defined on the x-rays: the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), the most coronal level of the      alveolar bone (BC) and the apical extent of bone loss (BD). In more detail, the location of      the CEJ will be identified; the most coronal area where the periodontal ligament retains an      even width will be identified on the radiograph to indicate the most apical extension of bone      loss. The infrabony defect will be calculated by measuring the width of the defect at the      most coronal aspect and at the base; the distance between CEJ-BD and BC-BD; the distance      between CEJ-BC; the angle between the vertical axis of the root and the interdental bone wall      (Tonetti et al. 1993). Radiographic evaluation of bone regeneration will be defined on a high      definition monitor by the same calibrated examiner who is blinded to the treatment modality      and does not have access to previous recordings. Assessments will be carried out using the      measurement tool for numerical measurements (VixWin™ Platinum|Gendex software) with reference      to a metal bar of standard length (5mm) that will be attached onto the sensor.      Collection of specimens Samples will be collected in the following order at six time points;      baseline, 6-weeks, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months.      (i) Saliva Saliva will be collected prior to clinical periodontal measurements or any      periodontal intervention and generally in the morning following an overnight fast during      which subjects are requested not to drink (except water) or chew gum. Whole saliva samples      will be obtained by expectorating into 30ml polypropylene tubes for 5 minutes.      (ii) GCF Gingival crevicular fluid samples will be obtained from the buccal interdental      aspects of the defects. Before GCF collection, the surfaces will be gently air dried and      isolated from saliva by placing cotton rolls and using a saliva ejector. Then, supragingival      plaque will be carefully removed with sterile curettes and paper strips (Periopaper, OraFlow      Inc., Smithtown, NY, USA) will be placed in the periodontal pocket until mild resistance is      felt for 30s. Care will be taken to avoid mechanical trauma when placing the strips and those      strips contaminated with blood will be discarded. Each strip per patient will be stored in a      separate 1.5ml micro-centrifuge tube, and stored at -70°C. Prior to use, the proteins on the      strips will be eluted into 500µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with BSA (1%      v/v).      (iii) Plaque Following GCF collection, subgingival plaque will be collected from the      designated site. The sampling area will be isolated from saliva, gently dried with air, and      after ensuring that no supragingival plaque deposits are present two paper points will be      placed for 30s into the periodontal pocket and a pooled sample will be collected. All samples      will be stored in Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) at -80°C before processing.      Paper points will be used for the collection of microbial plaque in order to avoid mechanical      disturbance of the periodontal tissues.      Data management The investigators must ensure that the subject's anonymity is maintained. On      any study-related documentation, subjects should only be identifiable by their initials,      gender, and/or subject number. Personal information (i.e. medical cards) will be kept in a      separate, secure location, away from other study specific data with restricted access to the      principal investigator only.      Informed consent process It is the responsibility of the principal investigator to obtain in      writing consent from the subject. The informed consent form will consist of two separate      documents; a Subject Information Form and a Subject Informed Consent Signature Form; both      documents will be approved by the Ethical committee of the Dental School, AUTh prior to the      study. The subject information form will provide an adequate explanation, in native      non-technical language that is understandable to the subject, of the aims, objectives,      methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study. The principal investigator      must then provide ample time for the subject to read and understand the informed consent form      and to consider participation in the clinical investigation. The principal investigator and      the subject must both sign and date the form before the subject can participate in the      clinical investigation. Each subject will then be issued with a copy of their duly signed and      dated informed consent form and any other written information.    ",,"

","      MSCs have been studied for the treatment of liver diseases as well as non-liver diseases.      MSCs have been successful in treating conditions like acute steroid-resistant GVHD in      hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients and also have shown to improve the MELD score      in end-stage liver disease. There were no severe side effects observed in using autologous      MSCs as a treatment option. The outcome of the studies done so far have been positive and it      is encouraged to study the use of MSCs as cell therapy for treating liver diseases.      The estimated rate of cirrhosis in HBV patients in Singapore is about 1.6% per year, rate of      hepatocellular carcinoma is about 0.8% per year overall and 3.0% per year in cirrhotic      patients. Knowing that there are not many options currently available for Liver Cirrhosis      patients and that they have a poor prognosis with an average life expectancy of < 12 months,      this study uses autologous MSCs to treat Liver Cirrhosis patients in Singapore. The objective      of the study is to demonstrate that autologous bone marrow is safe to be used in patients      with liver cirrhosis as well as demonstrate that bone marrow MSC may improve liver function      and prolong patient survival.    ","      Liver cirrhosis refers to extreme scarring of the liver, resulting in suboptimal function of      the liver. It can result from a variety of causes, ranging from hepatitis B and C infection,      excessive alcohol consumption, autoimmune causes, fatty liver and others. Irrespective of the      cause, once the liver becomes cirrhotic, it is a downhill course.      Liver cirrhosis is irreversible and most patients will progressively worsen over time. Once      liver cirrhosis has reached the stage of decompensation, that is, development of jaundice,      ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and coagulopathy the two-year survival      drops to about 50%.      The definitive treatment of decompensated cirrhosis is liver transplantation. While a liver      transplantation is potentially curative, the high costs, lack of a donor, treatment-related      mortality and the immunosuppression complications make this option possible only for a      limited number of patients. The vast majority do not have an effective option at all, thus      the need to develop alternative therapies. Various types of Stem Cells had been investigated      as a regenerative therapy for liver cirrhosis. These stem cells include bone marrow      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) and peripheral CD34      positive cells. Some early studies have shown encouraging results in patients who had      autologous bone marrow stem cell transplantation. There was improved liver function in these      patients with cirrhotic livers.      The sponsor is proposing a study to look into the role of MSC therapy for patients with liver      cirrhosis in Singapore. This will be a Phase I/II study with the main emphasis on the safety      profile first. The trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and local      regulatory requirement(s).

","      This is a Phase 1 Clinical Safety Study intended to provide preliminary assessments of the      safety, tolerability, and clinical alleviation of symptoms associated with Post Concussion      Syndrome (PCS), also known as Chronic Concussive Syndrome (CCS).    ","      The proposed study is a single-site, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving a      single administration of either individual, autologous ATCell™ lines suspended in 5% dextrose      lactated Ringer's solution or a vehicle (5% dextrose Lactated Ringer's solution) not      containing cells. Each ATCell™ cell line will be created from cells grown from the stromal      vascular fraction (SVF) of a participant's own adipose tissue collected by liposuction, and      each treated participant will only receive their own cells.      Within the treated group, 3 dosing levels will be explored: 50 million cells, 150 million      cells, or 300 million cells, and a Placebo group which will receive 5% dextrose lactated      Ringer's solution free of cells. Participant follow-ups will take place 1 day following the      tissue harvest procedure and, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following      ATCell™ treatment. Comprehensive participant's evaluations involving data collection will      take place 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment.      It has been proposed that in general, mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) events need to be      taken far more seriously, and that even mild TBI events can result in lasting negative      consequences as evidenced by lower performances on neuropsychological assessments when      compared with age-matched controls2. In fact, this condition may eventually lead to      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which, together      may be termed the AD-like dementias3, further underscoring the need for effective clinical      intervention. Currently, no effective treatments are available for this condition aside from      treatment of the symptoms, although some more comprehensive treatments have been proposed.    ",,"

","      This is a randomized and single blinded study aimed to compare the efficacy between      intramuscular autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells plus mesenchymal stem cell      implantation and intramuscular autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells implantation only in      patients with chronic critical limb ischemia. Patients will be randomized into two groups of      equal number; patients in one group will be implanted with mononuclear cells and mesenchymal      stem cells, and the other implanted with mononuclear cells only in the area of affected limb.    ","      When the long blood vessels supplying blood to the arms and legs become blocked (ischemic),      patient will experience painful sensations in their calves when they walked which slowly      become excruciating painful at rest. When the condition worsens, the patients will not be      able to feel any pain from their legs and they will not know if there are any small ulcers or      cuts on their legs. As a result, a small ulcer which goes unnoticed becomes bigger and can      sometimes become infected. In the worst situations, infection might lead towards gangrene and      septicaemia. Severe rest pain and/or ulcerations of ischemic limbs are defined as the state      of chronic critical limb ischemia and at this point, amputation of the affected limb is      suggested.      Conventional treatments include angioplasty/bypass operation to remove blood vessel blockage      to restore blood supply, the use of prescribed medicines to aid in ulcer recovery and clear      infection and debridement of damaged/infected tissue. Some procedures have to be performed      multiple times. Amputation is inevitable in many cases because some blood capillaries cannot      be corrected and restenosis of vessels is very common. Cell therapy with mononuclear cells      and mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow is promising because these stem cells are capable      of stimulating and regenerating capillaries and blood vessels.

","      Bone grafting is widely used in hospitals to repair injured, aged or diseased skeletal      tissue. In Europe, about one million patients encounter a surgical bone reconstruction      annually and the numbers are increasing due to our ageing population. Bone grafting intends      to facilitate bone healing through osteogenesis (i.e. bone generation) at the site of damage,      but this is only attained presently by including cells capable of forming bone into the      augmentation.      Bone autograft is the safest and most effective grafting procedure, since it contains      patient's own bone growing cells (to enhance osteogenesis) and proteins (to enhance      osteoinduction), and it providing a scaffold for the new bone to grow into (osteoconduction).      However, bone autograft is limited in quantity (about 20 cc) and its harvesting (e.g. from      the iliac crest) represents an additional surgical intervention, with frequent consequent      pain and complications.      We hypothesize that using autologous bone marrow cells expanded in GMP facility surgically      implanted with synthetic bone substitutes contribute to the resolution of the health and      socioeconomic complications of delayed union or non-union after diaphyseal and      metaphyseal-diaphyseal fractures with safety and efficacy.    ","      Tissue engineering combines bone marrow cells or mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), synthetic      scaffolds and molecular signals (growth or differentiating factors) in order to form hybrids      constructs. For bone reconstruction purposes, human MSCs have been seeded and cultured on      porous calcium phosphate ceramics in osteogenic media. Some clinical studies with low numbers      of patients have been reported using this approach but the outcomes were inconsistent with      low efficacy in bone regeneration. The reasons of the limited clinical success may be due to      several bottlenecks in the multidisciplinary field of bone tissue engineering. The      association in vitro of biomaterials and osteoprogenitor cells raises technical challenges      and regulatory and ethic issues for the implementation of clinical trials, whereas the      expansion of MSCs is now possible in GMP Facility.      The expected results are to obtain bone consolidation thus healing of delayed union or      non-union, as proven by imaging techniques, without using bone graft. This will prove the      efficacy of the proposed IMP based on pluripotent MSCs expanded in a GMP facility and mixed      with granulated biphasic calcium phosphate in the surgical setting before implantation. No      expected complications related to the procedure are expected. Changes in serum levels of bone      turnover markers will be described.    ",,"

",      The study is a phase I/II trial designed to establish the safety and efficacy of intravenous      administration of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to patients with      Parkinson's disease.    ,"      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the      loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. A combination of genetic and      environmental factors is likely to be important in producing abnormal protein aggregation      within select groups of neurones, leading to cell dysfunction and then death. A large number      of agents together with surgical interventions are now available to treat early and late      complications of PD, but they are suffer from two main drawbacks: side effects and loss of      efficacy with disease progression.      Bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) an differentiate under certain      circumstances into cells from various neuronal and glial type lineages; they also exert      immunomodulatory effects. PD-derived MSCs are similar to normal MSCs in phenotype,      morphology, and multidifferentiation capacity. Moreover, PD-derived MSCs are capable of      differentiating into neurons in a specific medium with up to 30% having the characteristics      of dopamine cells. These findings indicate that MSCs derived from PD patients' bone marrow      may be a promising cell type for cellular therapy.      BM-MSCs cultured with a cocktail of growth factors (containing FGF and BDNF) differentiate      into neuronal/glial lineage cells with a predominance of cells expressing astrocytes'      markers. They were effective in suppression of chronic EAE in mice and induced      neuroprotection, preserving most of the axons in the CNS of successfully-treated animals.      Histopathological studies revealed that MSCs could efficiently migrate into the CNS inflamed      tissue (both when administered intravenously and intraventricularly) and differentiated into      cells expressing neural-glial lineage markers. Such an approach may provide a feasible and      practical way for PD.    ",,"

",      The study is a phase I/II trial designed to establish the safety and efficacy of intravenous      combined with intrathecal administration of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem      cells to patients with spinal cord injury.    ,"      Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a traumatic disorder resulting in a functional deficit that      usually leads to severe and permanent paralysis. Pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies      to SCI get limited effect. Another promising therapeutic approaches for SCI is cellular      transplantation. Cell types used in SCI therapy include Schwann cells, olfactory ensheathing      cells and adult stem cells, such as neural stem cells, umbilical cord blood derived cells,      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells. There are not yet conclusive      evidences on which types of glial or adult stem cells are most effective in SCI treatment.      MSC have been shown to promote anatomical and functional recovery in animal models of SCI by      promoting tissue sparing ,axonal regeneration, and remyelination. Therapeutic effects of MSCs      are primarily due to the secretion of soluble factors and the provision of extracellular      matrix that provide protection and support repair. MSC are attractive candidates for      transplantation into human patients because they can be easily harvested, expanded and      banked, or derived directly from the patient allowing for autologous transplantation,      obviating the need for immune suppression.      The clinical translation of cellular transplantation strategies requires a safe and efficient      means of cellular delivery. In animal models of SCI, the most common delivery is direct      injection into the injury site, which allows a defined number of cells to be delivered, but      risks further injuring the cord. Less invasive methods for cell delivery have been      investigated, including intravascular delivery (intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial) and      delivery into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal). These minimally-invasive techniques      decrease the risk to the patient and allow delivery of multiple cell doses. Maybe intrathecal      administration is superior to IV delivery, cell engraftment and tissue sparing were      significantly better after intrathecal delivery, but more researches are needed for get      conclusion.

",      The goal of this study is to establish if mesenchymal stem cell augmentation improves graft      incorporation and to analyze the cytokine environment of the joint after osteochondral      allograft transplantation (OCA) with and without intra-articular bone marrow aspirate      concentrate (BMAC) injection. Information learned from this study can be used to      biochemically compare treatment response and to assess emerging therapeutic options that may      positively alter the biochemical environment in patients who suffer from articular cartilage      disorders.    ,"      Articular cartilage injuries in the knee continue to grow in number as detection and      treatment options have advanced. Treatment options, including microfracture, autologous      chondrocyte (cells that make cartilage) implantation, osteochondral grafting and meniscus      transplantation can hopefully deter the progression of degeneration and have promise to      function as disease modifying solutions. Osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) has      emerged as a preferred method of treating large focal chondral defects as it structurally      replaces the cartilage and often involved sub-chondral bone with native hyaline cartilage and      bone. The results of OCA are successful with greater than 85% survival at 5-year follow-up.      Failure can occur due to a lack of boney integration or low chondrocyte viability. Therefore,      anything to enhance the graft augmentation process may be useful in preventing failure. The      purpose of this prospective, randomized study is to determine the effect of bone marrow      aspirate concentrate (BMAC) containing bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells on      improving graft incorporation and preventing failure. The effect of BMAC on the graft and      intra-articular knee environment will be evaluated using 3 techniques: computed tomography      (CT) imaging, synovial fluid cytokine analysis, and serum biomarker analysis. Information      learned from this study can be used to biochemically compare treatment response and to assess      emerging therapeutic options that may positively alter the biochemical environment in      patients undergoing osteochondral allograft transplantation.

","      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of treating patients experiencing graft      failure after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with ex-vivo-expanded      BM-drived mesenchymal stem cells from third-party donors or mesenchymal stem cells combined      with cord blood. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of such      treatment on graft failure, and second object was to investigate the safety of such      treatment.    ","      Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) are considered the standard of      care for many malignancies, such as lymphoma, myeloma and some leukemias, and so on. Graft      failure after auto-HSCT is a formidable complication. It occurs in 2-9.5% of patients and is      associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections and hemorrhagic      complications. There are various options for the management of graft failure. The most common      treatment of graft failure is growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor      (G-CSF)and recombinant erythropoietin,but it usually effective in the short term and no      effect on platelet counts.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and      treating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell      transplantation and so on.As an important source of hematopoietic stem cell, cord blood has      been widely used in clinical practice. It is reported that cord blood combined with MSCs can      increase engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, to      our knowledge, the report about efficacy of treatment of graft that develops after auto-HSCT      using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor combined with cord blood is absent.If      such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be      used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because the generation of      donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if the clinical status      of a patient is urgent.      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors or MSCs combined with cord blood      in treating patients with graft failure after auto-HSCT.

","      Knee joint cartilage cells metabolize slowly, and it is difficult to repair themselves after      injury. Any knee joint trauma or the progression of osteoarthritis may lead to the      progression of cartilage or osteochondral defects. Compared with bone marrow mesenchymal stem      cells (MSCs), peripheral blood MSCs have better chondrogenic differentiation ability. At the      same time, the mobilization of peripheral blood MSCs and the advancement of extraction      technology also make it feasible to treat osteochondral damage by using peripheral blood      MSCs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of surgical      transplantation of autologous peripheral blood MSCs to repair knee joint Ⅳ-degree localized      cartilage injury, and to explore a new treatment for osteochondral defects based on the      foundation of the research group's previous research.

","      Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) has been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing      properties. Manifestations of systemic lupus eryhematosus(SLE) may in most patients be      ameliorated with medications that suppress the immune system. Nevertheless, there remains a      subset of SLE patients for whom current strategies are insufficient to control disease. The      investigators will infuse expanded autologous MSC into patients with lupus Nephritis. The      purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether this new therapeutical approach will result in      improvement in the lupus disease.    ","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or marrow stromal cells, are multipotential cells that reside      within the bone marrow and can be induced to differentiate into various components of the      marrow microenvironment, such as bone, adipose and stromal tissues under proper conditions.      It has been reported that MSCs can suppress maturation, activation and proliferation of T, B,      NK and DC cell in vitro and downregulate immune response in vivo. MSCs are presently being      cotransplantated with hematopoietic stem cell, which can facilitates engraftment of      hematopoietic stem cells and prevent GVHD. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an      autoimmune disorder that affects many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are illnesses that      occur when the body's tissues are attacked by its own immune system. Patients with lupus      produce abnormal antibodies in their blood that target tissues within their own body. Because      the antibodies and accompanying cells of inflammation can involve tissues anywhere in the      body, lupus has the potential to affect a variety of areas of the body. The origin of      autoantibody production in SLE is unclear but a role has been suggested for an antigen driven      process, spontaneous B-cell hyper-responsiveness, or impaired immune regulation.      The BXSB mouse strain spontaneously develops a progressive and lethal autoimmune disease,      similar to human SLE. In our previous work we found that transplantation of MSCs could      alleviate the symptoms of BXSB mouse.      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of expanded autologous MSC infusions in      patients with primary and treatment -refractory SLE. This study will last 2 years.      Participants will be assigned to receive either the prednisone (Group 1) or MSC infusions      alone (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study on Day 0. One      year post- infusions, Patients will be clinically assessed and evaluated for MSC and disease      response, and participants will undergo kidney biopsies at 12 Months.    ",,"

",      This study will examine the safety of two different cellular therapies in the treatment of      stroke.    ,"      Stroke remains a leading cause of death and disability. A limited number of therapies, such      as intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, have been approved to interrupt stroke in the      early hours after symptom onset. Many patients are not able to benefit from these therapies,      however, and so a need exists for development of new interventions to reduce disability after      stroke. This study will be an early step towards this, and will examine the safety of two      cell types, mononuclear cells and marrow stromal cells. In each case, the cells will be      autologous, specifically being derived from the subject's own bone marrow.    ","

",      This study seeks to bridge these technologies and obtain data regarding the safety and      efficacy of image guided percutaneous needle injection of expanded autologous bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stem cells to symptomatic degenerated intervertebral discs in humans. The      primary outcome will be to assess the safety and efficacy and monitor for adverse events.    ,"      Bone Marrow Aspiration and Cell Culture Procedure      Utilizing fluoroscopic guidance, a coaxial needle will be advanced to the bone marrow space.      The inner portion will be removed and 10-20mL of marrow aspirated.      MSCs will be isolated and cultured in the Case Western Reserve University National Center for      Regenerative Medicine/Seidman Cancer Center Cellular Therapy Lab using standard operating      procedures established under the ongoing IND - as above.      MSC Delivery/Transplantation Procedure      Utilizing fluoroscopic guidance, a needle will be advanced to the outer annulus of the      affected disc(s). Through the coaxial anchor, a needle will be advanced to the middle 1/3 of      the disc, and confirmed in two planes (AP and lateral).      On the day of infusion, MSCs will be transported from the Cellular Therapy Lab to the IR      suite in a validated dry shipper. MSCs will be thawed in a 37ºC water bath and drawn into 1      ml syringes. Prior to delivery, an aliquot of the infused product will be tested for      viability (trypan blue exclusion). Viability must be >70% for cell transplantation. Treatment      group one will receive an injection of 1-2 ml of a 2 x 106/ml concentration solution of MSCs      and treatment group 2 will 1-2 ml of a 4 x 106/ml concentration solution of MSCs. Both      treatment groups will be injected under intermittent fluoroscopic observation. A manometer      will be used to monitor disc pressures, especially during MSC injection keeping pressure      below 100 psi. Specifically, the volume of injectate will be determined based on three      dynamic factors: real time imaging of contained contrast volume during discography, psi as      measured during the injection (< 100), and patient's symptoms (if patient's pain exceeds      baseline, injection will be stopped) - up to a volume of 2cc of the assigned concentration.      An aliquot of infused product will be submitted to the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical      Center Microbiology Laboratory to test for microbiological contamination. In the event of a      positive microbial test following administration of a cellular product: 1) The Principal      Investigator and his/her designee will be notified and will notify the participant, 2) The      contaminant will identified to a species level and antibiotic sensitivities determined, 3)      The Medical Director of the Cellular Therapy Laboratory and/or the Principal Investigator      will determine the best course of action based on the clinical situation. This may include      blood cultures, administration of prophylactic antibiotics, and repeat cultures on the cell      product. 4) An investigation to determine the source of the contamination will be conducted,      and appropriate corrective measures will be undertaken. Finally, the adverse event will be      reported to the IRB and FDA based on the respective federal and institutional reporting      requirement, as well the approved data safety monitoring board charter.      MRI/Quantitative MRI Procedure      Routine images of the lumbar spine (sagittal and axial T1 and T2 weighted images) will be      obtained for the purposes of: Monitoring for potential alternative effects of the cells      including osteophyte formation, as well as any unexpected local outcome. In addition, a      quantative MRI including fingerprinting. Magnetic resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) allows rapid      and simultaneous quantification of T1and T2 relaxation times. The MRF sequence is based on      varying multiple MR acquisition parameters [ e.g. flip angle (FA) and time of repetition      (TR)] in a pseudorandom manner, such that unique signal evolutions called ""fingerprints"" are      generated for each combination of tissue properties. These fingerprints are compared with a      dictionary of simulated fingerprints generated for that sequence by a pattern matching      process. Once there is a pattern match, the T1 and T2 values used to generate that dictionary      entry are assigned to that voxel and used to create T1 and T2 maps that are perfectly      anatomically co-registered.      For spine, the proposed MRF sequence is based on a multislice Fast Imaging with Steady      Precession (FISP) acquisition. Scanning will be done both in sagittal and axial planes using      a multislice acquisition. The scan parameters are as follows:      FOV: 400 mm, matrix 400 x 400 mm , TR/TE: 13-15 msec, in-plane resolution 1 x 1 mm, section      thickness 5 mm, flip angle 5-75 degrees, acquisition time ~ 39 seconds per slice, with ~ 4      minutes scan time for a 5 slice sagittal image. In axial plane, the disc would be covered at      each intervertebral level in 4-5 transverse slices and each axial acquisition would take ~ 3      minutes scan time.      The MRF maps would be directly generated as DICOM images using Gadgetron online      reconstruction. Image analysis would be done using a DICOM viewing software to draw Regions      of Interest (ROIs) on nucleus pulposus for direct quantification of relaxation times. There      is the capacity to generate MRF maps from raw data on Matlab which can also be used to draw      ROIs for simultaneous quantification of T1 and T2 relaxation times.      These values will be calculated on the pre and post treatment MRIs.    ",,"

Changes in Pain -Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for back pain
Baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year
Temporal evaluation of pain before and after the procedure will be analyzed through documentation of Visual Analogue Scale of back pain (VAS).
The VAS is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity The instrument is presented by a straight horizontal line of fixed length, usually 100 mm. The ends are defined as the extreme limits of the parameter to be measured (symptom, pain, health) orientated from the left (worst) to the right (best). Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the ""no pain"" anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity. No pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm) (11).

Changes in Pain - Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores over time
Baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year
Temporal evaluation of pain before and after the procedure will be analyzed through documentation of Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores over time. Scoring - For each section the total possible score is 5: if the first statement is marked the section score = 0; if the last statement is marked, it = 5. If all 10 sections are completed the score is calculated. Interpretation scores go from minimal 0% disability to 100% disability.

changes in Quality of life - Short form Health Survey 36 (SF-36)
Baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 1 year
Temporal evaluation of quality of life before and after the procedure will be analyzed through documentation of SF36 quality of life questionnaire scores. Although this study is not cancer related, this questionnaire is a validated instrument for the evaluation of treatment related impact on quality of life - a critical outcome measure. Scoring - consisting of eight scaled scores which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.

","      This is an open label, single arm, single center investigation to assess the safety and      efficacy of purified adult autologous bone marrow derived specific populations of stem cells      and mesenchymal stem cells injected into the ovaries (intraovarian injection), through a 12      week follow-up period. The investigators' chosen model of study is based on increasing the      efficiency of the approach by choosing an autologous model which preserves the genetic      composition of an individual that is vital in infertility conditions. Additionally the      approach involves transplanting a combination of specific purified stem cell types which all      aid in ovarian function recovery.    ","      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is characterized as hypergonadotropic ovarian failure mostly      prevalent before age 40. It is astonishingly frequent and affects around 1% of women below      the age of 40. The clinical findings include amenorrhea and abnormally high levels of      luteinizing (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). The etiology of POF is unidentified      in the majority of cases. It can occur due to a combination of genetics, immunological      diseases, and environmental factors. POF is characterized by lack of secondary follicles,      arrested folliculogenesis, decreased estrogen levels, and female infertility.      Currently, no available therapeutic intervention has been verified effective in retrieving      fertility in patients with POF. Several trials at ovarian stimulation are typically      ineffective. Consequently, the diagnosis of POF can cause great physical and emotional      distress among patients. Hence, there is serious need to develop innovative treatment plans      for POF.      The latest research shows that reduced ovarian reserve is caused by aging of the niche rather      than a defect in germ cell lines. Current scientific evidence suggests that bone      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) could repair injured tissues and holds great      promise in treating many diseases including male and female infertility.      The uniqueness of this study is demonstrated in the transplantation of purified specific      populations of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)      into patients with POF without in vitro expansion or culture, with minimal manipulation. Stem      cells are withdrawn and transplanted back into the patient on the same day of the procedure,      thus presenting the highest safety and efficacy parameters.    ",,"

Mesenchymal stem cells are      undifferentiated cells which can undergo self-renewal & differentiation into other cell types      like muscle cells; thus can be used to regenerate the damaged sphincter muscles. In this      study mesenchymal stem cells will be obtained from bone marrow from the patient, processed, &      then re-injected periurethrally. Effectiveness will be compared to that of the surgical      treatment (tension-free vaginal tape).

History Full medical history will be taken from each patient, together with detailed           history as regards voiding habits, incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urinary infection.           Questionnaire about incontinence, & questionnaire about quality of life will be           obtained.        3. Examination Complete physical and pelvic examination to evaluate the presence of stress           urinary incontinence, & to exclude patients with marked hypermobility of the urethra, or           severe cystocele or rectocele.        4. Urodynamic study A multi-channel urodynamic study using Euet Sensik ® will be performed           including cystometry, urethral pressure measurement, abdominal leak point pressure           (ALPP) measurement, & residual urine measurement. Patients with stress urinary           incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency will be selected. Criteria for           selection are: absence of involuntary contractions during leakage caused by a stress           maneuver; low ALPP (<60 cmH2O); & maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) <20-30 cmH2O.           Patients with voiding dysfunction will be excluded (residual urine volume >100ml).        5. Cells retrieval, culture, & processing:           * Bone marrow aspiration:           -Site: posterior superior iliac crest.           -Procedure: The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with the top leg           flexed and the lower leg straight. The iliac crest is palpated, and the preferred           sampling site is marked with a pen. Aseptic technique is employed, including sterile           gloves and gown. The site is prepared with an antiseptic (povidone-iodine), scrubbed,           and draped, exposing only the site to be sampled. The skin and the underlying tissue to           the periosteum are infiltrated with a local anaesthetic (approximately 10 mL of 1%           Xylocaine [lidocaine]). A 10-mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle is used to inject an           initial 0.5 mL directly under the skin, raising a wheal. A 22-gauge needle is used to           penetrate deeper into the subcutaneous tissue and the underlying periosteum, an area           roughly 1 cm in diameter. A skin incision is made with a small surgical blade, through           which the bone marrow aspiration needle, with a stylet locked in place, is inserted.           Once the needle contacts the bone, it is advanced by slowly rotating clockwise and           counter clockwise until the cortical bone is penetrated and the marrow cavity is           entered. The depth of the penetration should not extend beyond an initial 1cm. Once           within the marrow cavity, the stylet is removed. Using a 20 mL syringe, approximately 5           mL of bone marrow are aspirated. Subsequent specimens are obtained by attaching a           separate syringe, collecting 5 mL at a time. The samples are then transferred into an           ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -containing tube. The marrow needle is removed,           and pressure is applied to the aspiration site with gauze until any bleeding stops.           * Cells processing & culture:           - Mononuclear cells (MNCs) will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation using           Ficol/Hypaque.           - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be isolated through plastic adherence by the           seeding of MNCs in T25 tissue culture flasks in complete culture media (DMEM, 1%           antibiotics/antifungal, 20% autologous serum). Flasks will be incubated at 37ºC in CO2           incubator for 3-5 days.           - After 5 days, flasks will be evaluated under inverted microscope for the number and           morphology of MSCs. Non-adherent cells will be discarded and medium replenished.           - Half of the medium will be changed every 3 days.           - Flasks will be evaluated until cells reach about 80-90% confluence.             -  MSCs will be harvested using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 5 minutes. Afterwards,                trypsin action will be stopped by the addition of autologous serum.             -  MSCs will be washed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), counted, tested for                viability using trypan blue exclusion test.             -  MSC will be identified using immunophenotypic markers (positive for CD44 and                negative for CD34).             -  Cells will be suspended in sterile saline, a minimum of 20 X 106 MSCs cells in a 10                cc syringe, ready for injection.           Quality control check for the sterility by the performance of bacterial aerobic and           anaerobic cultures will be done to ensure the complete aseptic conditions during the           specimen retrieval, preparation, storage, and injection. (Gunetti et al., 2012)        6. Injection of cells:           The patient will be placed in lithotomy position. A Foley's catheter (size 18) will be           inserted in the urethra, then under local anaesthesia; retrieved cells (total 20- 30           million cells per patient in 10cc syringe) (Sebe et al., 2011) will be injected into the           submucosal tissue at the level of the proximal urethra just distal to the bladder neck           (guided by stretch on the Foley's catheter), at 3,9,12 o'clock, injecting around 3.5 cc           in each site.        7. Tension-free vaginal tape (TVT):           Another 25 patients will undergo surgical intervention, which is the ""tension-free           vaginal tape"" operation at the obstetrics & gynecology department - Ain Shams Maternity           Hospital - urogynecology unit. In this technique, a small midurethral incision will be           made in the vaginal mucosa, then a polypropylene 40*1cm mesh tape attached to two curved           trocars will be passed lateral to the urethra & through the endopelvic fascia into the           retropubic space. The trocar will then be passed along the back of the pubic bone,           through the rectus fascia, in two small suprapubic skin incisions, then the tension on           the tape adjusted & the remaining tape cut off at the level of the skin.        8. Follow up:      Follow up visits will be conducted at 3months, 6months, 9months, and 12months after therapy.      Clinical examination, incontinence questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire, & urodynamic      study will be done.      ** Data collection & recording:      Each patient will have a case record form (CRF) in which the following data will be recorded:        -  Age, parity        -  Body mass index (BMI).        -  Type of intervention (stem cell therapy or TVT)        -  International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form           (ICIQ-UI SF) on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.        -  Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) Instrument Score on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m           post-injection.        -  Cough test on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.        -  Urodynamic study on admission & 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.             -  Statistical analysis:      Descriptive statistics for measured variables will be expressed as range, mean and standard      deviation (for metric data); range, median and interquartile range (for discrete data); and      number and proportions (for categorical data). Pre-injection & post-injection findings will      be compared using the t-test or the Wilcoxon test depending on whether the measured      parameters were Gaussian variables. A P-value of 0.05 or less will be considered      statistically significant.      ** Ethical considerations:        1. Delegation of investigator responsibilities:           The investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately           informed about the protocol, & their trial-related duties and functions. The           investigator will maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified           person to whom he or she has delegated significant trial-related duties.        2. Patient information and informed consent Before being admitted to the clinical study,           the patient must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible           consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to her.           An informed consent document, in Arabic language, contains all locally required elements           and specifies who informed the patient. After reading the informed consent document, the           patient must give consent in writing. The patient's consent must be confirmed at the           time of consent by the personally dated signature of the patient and by the personally           dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. If the           patient is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written informed           consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence           of an impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by           the personally dated signature of the patient or by a local legally recognized           alternative (e.g., the patient's thumbprint or mark). The witness and the person           conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the           consent document. The original signed consent document will be retained by the           investigator. The investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required           only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.        3. Confidentiality Only the patient number and patient initials will be recorded in the           CRF, and if the patients name appears on any other document, it must be kept in privacy           by the investigators. The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification           list (patient numbers with the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be           identified.        4. Protocol approval Before the beginning of the study and in accordance with the local           regulation followed, the protocol and all corresponding documents will be declared for           ethical and research approval by the council of ob/gyn department, Ain Shams University;           according to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki.

","      This is a prospective, open-label, single-dose, single-arm phase I-II study in which 15      patients diagnosed with gonarthrosis grade II-III (Kellgren and Lawrence) will enter the      study with the primary objective of assessing the feasibility and safety of the knee      articular infiltration of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Secondary      objectives are to assess the efficacy by imaging procedures and clinical questionnaires.      MSC obtained from each patient's bone marrow will be isolated and expanded ""Ex-Vivo"" under      GMP conditions at Xcelia-División de Terapias avanzadas del Banc de Sang I Teixits. After 21      days, patients will be implanted a single-dose of approximately 40 millions of autologous MSC      in the knee by articular injection, and followed up for 12 month. Articular cartilage changes      will be determined by T2-weighted MRI (Cartigram) at 6 and 12 month. Clinical assessment will      measure the pain by the visual analogue scale (VAS), the self-reported functional status by      Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the quality of life by Short Form 36 questionnaire      (SF-36) at 3, 6 and 12 month.

","      Nonunion of long bones would occur in almost 10% of fractures and because of its long term      and complicated treatment, is known as a therapeutic challenge for both of the surgeons and      patients.      Cell therapy is useful in treatment of nonunion and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells are the      best candidates for this kind of treatment.      Percutaneous implantation of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cell in      combination with PL will be done in 30 patients with tibia nonunion. The other 30 patients as      the control group will receive placebo. The patients will be followed at 2weeks, 3months, 6m      and 12 months after implantation.      The Spss(v16) software will be used for data analysis.    ",      Long bone nonunion is known as a therapeutic challenge for both the orthopedic surgeons and      the society. Current treatment of this disorder is autologous bone graft. This treatment has      potential minor and major complications and is considered as a risky treatment. So researches      are focused on new treatment approaches for this disease.      Cell therapy is one of these new approaches especially based on mesenchymal stromal cells.

",      The benefit of current stem cell transplantation therapy for myocardial infarction is limited      by low survival rate for stem cell. The purpose of this study is to test whether intensive      Atorvastatin therapy can improve the outcome of patients with impaired left ventricle      function after acute myocardial infarction who underwent intracoronary transfer of autologous      bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.    ,"      The major challenge to a successful stem cell therapy for myocardial infarction is the low      survival rate of implanted cells in the damaged tissue. Atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase      inhibitor, has multiple biological activities independent of cholesterol-lowering action.This      study is performed to find out more information about the strategy with Atorvastatin therapy      to improve the survival of implanted cells, autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells      transplantation. Patients between 30 and 75 years of age who receive autologous bone marrow      mesenchymal stem cells transplant may be eligible for this study. These patients receive      autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells transplantation intracoronary undergoing      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with regular or high dose of Atorvastatin treatment. The      objective evaluations will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up.      Heart function tests may include the following:      Electrocardiogram (EKG) evaluates the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes placed on      the chest transmit information from the heart to a machine.      Echocardiogram (Echo) is an ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create an image of the      heart and examine the function of the heart chambers and valves.      Gated acquisition scan is a nuclear medicine test that uses a small amount of radioactive      chemical injected into a vein. A special scanner creates an image of the heart for examining      the beating motion of the muscle.      MRI evaluates function of the heart chambers the beating motion of the muscle.    ",,"

","      Surgical reconstructive procedures for rotator cuff tears present a number of limitations.      The few studies in which the repair integrity is evaluated, have shown the existence of a      high rate of reruptures in spite of the fact that the functional results obtained short-term      are satisfactory. Morphologic analysis from the sutures, after different follow-up periods,      has not shown satisfactory results.      Thus, the purpose of the current study was to test the hypotheses that mesenchymal stem cells      (MSCs) included in a membrane into rotator cuff tears improves, the radiograms and the      function compared to cell-free tendon defect treatment.    ","      The investigators will include: Patients with massive tears from the supraspinatus tendon, in      which reconstructive surgery is indicated. Patients will be randomly stratified into two      groups.      The first group will receive autologous MSCs transplantation included in a collagen type I      membrane (OrthADAPT) and the second group will serve as cell-free controls.      The surgical procedure will be performed by arthroscopic and/or combined technique:      arthroscopic subacromial decompression and mini-open rotator cuff repair. The OrthADAPT-cells      composite will be put on the sutured area. The radiograms and function will be assessed by      independently observers, who will no have knowledge of the study group from which they will      have been obtained.    ",,"

","      Various preclinical animal studies have shown the potential of stem cells in re-vascularising      ischemic limbs and promoting collateral vessel formation. SVF have the potential to      facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and skeletal muscle. Early pilot clinical      studies indicate that stem-cell transplantation is feasible and may have beneficial effects      in CLI. Injury or inflammation is a prerequisite for the participation of circulating stem      cells to home and differentiate on to this microenvironment. The increased vascular      permeability and expression of adhesion proteins like integrin assist in stem cell homing.      The migratory capacity of stem cells is dependent on natural growth factors such as vascular      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Stromal cell derived factor (SDFI) and stem cell factor      (SCF). The expression of VEGF, SDFI and SCF is highly unregulated in the hypoxic muscular      tissue and is responsible for the recruitment of the stem cells to assist in the repair      mechanism and consequent improvement in limb function.      In addition to the above regenerating potential of SVF, they have several advantages; they      can be easily isolated without further culturing it. Most importantly SVF have shown to have      significantly highest expression of pluripotent markers similar to that of human embryonic      stem cells and yet they are non-tumorogenic and safe.      MSCs are having angiogenic activity and hence may be excellent source to develop      neo-vasculature and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating      Critical Limb Ischemia. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules      involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix19      Adipose derived Stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in      preclinical studies to be safe and effective.      The current Phase I/II study of adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal      stem cells is conducted with the broad objective of establishing safety and efficacy.    ","      Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained      from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes,      endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs).      In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells.      These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast      cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells,      to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta      (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among      others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular      matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue      extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural      regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried      out in cGMP compliance clean room.      Pure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial      eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.      Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are      present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the      nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can      be expanded in vitro ≥ 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several      mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High      expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to      isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles,      Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control      and release criteria.      Beside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used      allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have      positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo,      and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous      population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability      to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even      when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating      into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium      and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but      also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in      vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts,      chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate      into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by      increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially      injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood      flow increases, and contractility improves.      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules      involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to      mesenchymal tissue.

","      This trial is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that freshly      cultured, autologous mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) grown in platelet lysate-containing      medium will modulate recipient T-cell immune responses and promote engraftment in      haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. As a phase I, dose escalation      trial of autologous MSCs in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) undergoing haploidentical      HCT, the main aim is to evaluate the safety of this therapy with a secondary aim to evaluate      its effects on engraftment and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

Histological examination of the liver must document the                  absence of cirrhosis, bridging fibrosis and active hepatitis. The absence of                  bridging fibrosis will be determined using the histological grading and staging                  scale as described by Ishak and colleagues (1995).          -  Must be HLA typed at high resolution using DNA based typing at HLA-A, -B, -C and DRB1             and have an available related haploidentical bone marrow donor with 2, 3, or 4 (out of             8) HLA-mismatches. A unidirectional mismatch in either the graft versus host or host             versus graft direction is considered a mismatch.        Exclusion Criteria:          -  Availability of an 8 of 8 (HLA-A, B, C and DRB1) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched             sibling or matched unrelated donor          -  Presence of donor directed HLA antibodies.          -  Severe pulmonary disease (despite above oxygen saturation and DLCO) including severe             and uncontrolled asthma (per 2007 NHLBI Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of             Asthma Expert Panel Report 3;             http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/asthma-guidelines/full-report),             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or pulmonary hypertension (PH). A diagnosis             of pulmonary hypertension (PH) will be made by finding of mean pulmonary artery             pressure (mPAP) <25 mm Hg on right heart catheterization. In patients unable and/or             unwilling to undergo cardiac catheterization, patients will be excluded with the             following constellation of findings based upon presumptive diagnosis of PH (PPV of             62%): TRJ velocity >2.5 m/sec AND either N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide             (NT-pro-BNP) ≥160 pg/ml OR 6-minute walk distance <333 m.          -  Uncontrolled bacterial, viral or fungal infection in the 6 week before enrollment          -  Seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)          -  Previous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)          -  Participation in a clinical trial in which the patient received an investigational             drug or device or the off-label use of a drug or device within 3 months of enrollment          -  Demonstrated lack of compliance with prior medical care          -  Unwilling to use approved contraception for at least 6 months following transplant          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding females          -  Allergy to any component of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) suspension (such as human             albumin) and/or allergy to any drugs used in HCT conditioning regimen.

The investigational product is autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As it does      not use allogenic tissue and is incubated without additional genetic modification or      mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous      cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.      It primarily aims to regenerate cartilage, to improve pain and joint function. The      intra-articular injection of the investigational product is expected to stimulate the      regeneration and growth of cartilage, and to innovatively improve pain and joint function      with cartilage regeneration compared to high tibial osteotomy alone.

","      Peritoneal fibrosis may be occurred as a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis. It's      the main factor of UFF that could lead to the Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS). Using      the potential features of MSCs in the treatment of fibrosis may offer new insights into      reconstruction the damaged tissues. The project intends to transplant autologous MSCs to ten      peritoneal dialysis patients with ultra-filtration failure. It's going to study infusion      effects in clinical, cellular and molecular levels.      So in this trial, we will evaluate the effects of this intervention after intravenous      injection of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in 10 peritoneal dialysis      patients with ultra filtration failure (UFF). Fifteen UFF patients are also considered as the      control group. Then they will be followed 20, 45 and 90 days, and also 4 and 6 months after      first injection.    ","      Chronic kidney disease is defined as a reduced glomerular filtration rate, increased urinary      albumin excretion, or both, and is an increasing public health issue. Prevalence is estimated      to be 8-16% worldwide. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease and usually means      that the patient requires renal replacement therapy (RRT), which may involve a kidney      transplant or a form of dialysis. One of the options in RRT is continuous ambulatory      peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). CAPD is characterized by a continuous removal of extracellular      fluid by peritoneal membrane. It should be noted that like any other peritoneal dialysis      therapy, CAPD has Short or long-term complications and UFF is the most common functional      disorder in which the peritoneal ultrafiltration membrane damaged.      This project intends to evaluate, the role of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in      improvement of peritoneal membrane function in peritoneal dialysis patients who have      ultrafiltration failure up to 6 months.      In this study, 10 male and female subjects who are on peritoneal dialysis for at least two      years and have ultrafiltration failure with age range of 18 to 70 years will be enrolled.      Patients will be selected from peritoneal dialysis patients attending the peritoneal dialysis      ward of Dr. Shariati hospital. The main inclusion criteria is to be on peritoneal dialysis      for at least last two years and having Ultrafiltration failure. After obtaining the consent      form, a sample of fat tissue will be obtained by a general surgeon under sterilized condition      from patients and then in the specialized lab, the mesenchymal stem cells will be separated      and cultured to reach appropriate numbers (106/kg). The cells will be injected through      peripheral vein in hospital setting. Patients will be followed-up (clinically and laboratory)      at baseline and at week 3, week 6, month 3, month 4 and month 6. The clinical assessment and      peritoneal function tests will be performed in each visit. Outcome measures: The main outcome      measures that periodically will be assessed include: D/P cr, D/P urea, D0/D glucose, PET,      KT/V urea, Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)    ",,"

","      Background: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a potent alkylating agent that targets several organs,      especially lung tissue. SM exposure leads to serious changes in morphological structure of      airway system, which is associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary deficiency following      exposure to SM. With extensive progress and achievements in tissue repair through stem cells      therapy, consideration of lung tissue has been increased due to the high prevalence of      pulmonary problems. Several factors such as selection of cell types, required conditions for      growth and proliferation of stem cells, and the process of entering into the body to repair      damaged lung tissue are considered as the most important problems in this issue. Accumulating      studies, both in animals and human with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) support the hypothesis      of therapeutic effects of these cells in various disorders. In this study investigators aimed      to evaluate safety and potential efficacy of systemic MSC administration for treatment of      chronic lung injuries in SM-exposed patients.      Methods: Patients will receive 100 million MSC cells every two months for three injections      within 6 months. After each injection, parameters including safety, pulmonary function      testing (PFT), quality-of-life indicators, 6 minute walk test (6MWT), and expression of      inflammation and oxidative stress genes will be evaluated.    ","      Patients selection:      In this clinical trial, investigators considered therapeutic effect of MSCs in SM-exposed      male patients.Patients, had a documented encounter with SM during the Iran-Iraq war. The      patients signed informed consent before study. They were selected according to the following      criteria: (a) the severity of lung injury was ranged from moderate 50< forced expiratory      volume in 1 second (FEV1) <65 to severe 40<FEV1<50; (b) absence of contraindications      spirometry (hemoptysis, cerebral arterial aneurysm or aortic, pulmonary embolism,      uncontrolled blood pressure, recent pneumothorax, no doubt surgery/thoracic recent, recent      stroke); and (c) no coagulation. The exclusion criteria for the selection process were as      follow: (a) participate in another study at the same time; (b) smoking habitat; (c) the      existence of pneumonia during the study; (d) the incidence of transfusion reaction; (e)      underlying other diseases (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes).      Isolation and culture of adipose derived stem cells:      200mL of abdominal adipose tissue was obtained under local anesthesia by liposuction      aspirates protocol. The lipoaspirate was washed with PBS to remove tissue debris. 100mL PBS      containing 0.1% w/v collagenase A type I was added to isolated tissue and then incubated at      37ºC for 60 minutes. Collagenase activity was neutralized using MEM medium along with 10%      fetal bovine serum. Cell pellets were resuspended in culture medium after centrifugation at      2000rpm for 10 min, and then transferred to culture flasks for 72 h at 37ºC in 5% CO2      condition. The culture medium in the flasks was changed every 3 days, and cells were passaged      for two times.      Flow cytometry analysis:      To analyze the cell surface antigen expression, 5×105 fresh cells from third passage were      harvested by trypsin-EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 100 g for 1 min, resuspended in stain      buffer (PBS, 2% FBS) and then incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Trypsin was neutralized by      centrifuge and isolated cells were washed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in stain      buffer. Cells were incubated in dark environment for 30 minutes. After incubation, the cells      were labeled with anti-human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) conjugated to fluorochromes. These      antibodies were as follow: anti-CD90-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), CD73-phycoerythrin      (PE), CD11b-FITC, CD34-FITC, CD44-FITC, CD45-PE, CD105-PE. The frequencies of all      immunolabeled cells were analyzed by FACS Canto II flow cytometer, in which approximately      500,000 events were assessed and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (version 10.0).      Karyotype analysis for abnormalities detection:      Standard Giemsa staining procedure was performed and chromosome preparations were obtained      from 80% confluent cells. To stop microtubule formation, the cells were treated with Colcemid      solution. The mitotic arrested cells were then harvested using trypsin-EDTA. The cells were      extracted and then immersed in 75 mmol/l KCl for 30 minute at laboratory temperature.      Finally, they obtained by a centrifugation. The supernatant was replaced with fixative      solution and the suspension was spread over slides for microscopic examination and imaging.      At least, 15 metaphase spreads were analyzed. The karyotypes were considered with light      microscope using a cytovision software.      Freezing and Storage of Adipose-derived Stem Cells:      ADMSCs were harvested at 90% confluence before injection for freezing. To collect cells,      culture medium was removed and replaced with sterile PBS and after three minutes it was      replaced with trypsin-EDTA solution and then incubated at 37°C for 5 minutes. Complete medium      (MEM with 10% FBS) was added to inactivate the trypsin, and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5      minutes. Cell pellet was resuspended in cryopreservation medium (80% FBS, 10%      dimethylsulfoxide and 10% MEM medium) with a final concentration of 5 million cells per      milliliter and aliquoted into cryovials. The vials stored at -80 °C overnight and then      transferred into a liquid nitrogen container for long-term storage.      MSCs injection and Study plan:      Patients received 100×106 cells every 20 day for four injections within 2 months and screened      for 7 times. MSCs were injected intravenously along with 300 ml normal saline to the patient      at a maximum rate of 2×106 cells/min. Each infusion took approximately 30 minute to be      completed. After each injection, patient stayed at hospital for at least 6h as recovery time.      Efficacy of MSCs treatment in these patients were evaluated using the following parameters:      pulmonary functions test (PFTs) [forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), Forced vital      capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC], total lung capacity by body plethysmography, single-breath carbon      monoxide diffusing capacity (CO diffusion) , exercise performance [6-minute walk test      (6MWT)], Borg scale dyspnea assessment (BSDA), COPD Assessment Test (CAT), St. George's      Respiratory Questionnaire (SRGQ) and comprehensive safety evaluation.

There are complex sets of non-hematopoietic cells in bone marrow called mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs). MSCs are well-known as multipotent cells that have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into a great variety of cells. MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood and adipose tissue, and cultured in specific media. MSC colony formation, which is known as marrow-like stromal cells and MPCs, is similar to fibroblast colony forming unit (CFU-F) in in vitro condition.

","      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common joint diseases.This disease commonly develops      in the weight bearing joints of the lower limbs, such as the knee and hip joints.      Osteoarthritis is considered a chronic degenerative disorder that is characterized by a loss      of articular cartilage. Pathogenesis can involve all of the major articular tissues including      cartilage, synovial membrane, subchondral bone and other connective tissues such as ligaments      and tendons3. There is no effective therapy available today that alters the pathobiologic      course of the disease.In view of vast role of platelet derived growth factors, mesenchymal      cells and its safety, this prospective clinical trial is designed in an attempt to compare      the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells enhanced with platelet rich plasma in early stages of      knee osteoarthritis.    ","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic progenitor cells isolated from adult      tissues. These are characterized in vitro by their extensive proliferative ability in an      uncommitted state while retaining the potential to differentiate along various lineages of      mesenchymal origin, including chondrocyte, osteoblast, and adipocyte lineages, in response to      appropriate stimuli.MSCs can be induced to undergo chondrogenic differentiation in vitro and      in vivo. Centeno et al.in 2008 reported about the beneficial effects of autologous      mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis of knee. The regenerative effects of MSCs in      osteoarthritis can be due to their ability to differentiate themselves into chondrocytes and      structurally repair the articular cartilage. Recently, MSCs have been shown to possess many      potent paracrine effects through secretion of various soluble factors which can influence the      local tissue environment and exert protective effects with an end result of effectively      stimulating regeneration in situ. Recently Amgad etal.in their study reported even more      effective results with use of platelet rich plasma along with mesenchymal stem cells.      Platelets play an instrumental role in the normal healing response via the localsecretion of      growth factors and recruitment of reparative cells. Its use in orthopaedic began early in      this decade as PRP was used with bone grafts to augment spinal fusion and fracture healing.      Wakitani et al. in 1994 described repair of defects in articular cartilage in rabbits.Murphy      et al.studied the effects of autologous mesenchymal stem cells in caprine knee joints.Quarto      et al.reported the ability of mesenchymal stem cells to repair a large musculoskeletal defect      with successful healing of a large bone defect in three patients. Centeno et al. reported one      case in which they showed that isolated and expanded autologous mesenchymal stem cells when      percutaneously injected into a knee with symptomatic and radiographic osteoarthritis,      resulted in significant cartilage growth, decreased pain and increased joint mobility. Mishra      et al. reported that PRP could enhance the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, and that      TGFbeta and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which are factors present within PRP,      were important for chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs.Hence present study is designed to      study the efficacy of use of PRP enhanced mesenchymal stem cells in osteoarthritis knee.      AIMS AND OBJECTIVES        1. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Platelet rich plasma enhanced autologous           mesenchymal stem cells versus platelet rich plasma in knee osteoarthritis.        2. To correlate the clinical improvement with the radiological findings.    ",,"

",      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) in the treatment of non-healing wounds.    ,"      Sixty-six (66) subjects are planned to be enrolled into the trial. each subject's duration of      participation will be 24 weeks on therapy with a 4 week post-treatment visit. A run-in phase      of 2 weeks will be required prior to randomization/enrollment.      All subjects will receive appropriate and standard care for chronic wounds, including      dressings, bandages, and off-loading, if required. All subjects will receive either saline,      fibrin or MSCs in fibrin using an identical double-barreled syringe to keep the blind.      Therefore, subjects will then be randomized to one of three groups:        1. conventional standard therapy and control saline spray        2. conventional standard therapy and fibrin spray        3. conventional standard therapy and MSCs (autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem           cell)in fibrin spray      Screening Visit:      All inclusion and exclusion information will be reviewed to make sure that the subject is      eligible for entry into the study. The following procedures will be performed during this two      week period:      Biopsy - One (3 x 6 mm) biopsy will be taken from the edge of the wound for additional      diagnostic tests and for culturing of cells. The second (3-4 mm) biopsy will be taken from      the thigh for culturing of cells in the laboratory to assess the healing process. The thigh      biopsy will then be excised by taking about 3/4 inch long by 1/4 inch wide margin from around      it, and suturing it closed. The reason for this biopsy of the normal skin is so that it can      be used to compare the healing process to the chronic wound.      Blood Sampling - Blood will be drawn for laboratory testing to assess the overall well-being,      HIV, Hepatitis B & C and if the subject is a woman able to bear children, to test for      pregnancy.      Wound Measurements - Wound measurements will be taken to determine the size of the wound and      to assess for healing.      Randomization Visit:      If the wound has not reduced significantly in size, and the subject is still eligible for the      study; he/she will be assigned to a study treatment. The decision as to which treatment      he/she will receive will be determined by a process called randomization. Randomization is a      mathematical process used to guarantee that each participant in the study has an equal chance      of being assigned to any of the treatment options available.      The treatment groups that the subject may be assigned to are as follows:      Group #1 - Conventional Therapy and Control Saline Spray -The subject will receive      conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography and observations. At the Day 1      treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically normal      saline to the wound. Up to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2      or 3 days).      Group #2 -Conventional Therapy and Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional      therapy, wound measurements, photography, and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a      double-barrel syringe system will be used to deliver topically fibrin alone to the wound. Up      to 2 additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days).      Group #3 - Conventional Therapy and Autologous Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in      Fibrin Spray - The subject will receive conventional therapy, wound measurements, photography      and observations. At the Day 1 treatment visit a double-barrel syringe system will be used to      deliver topically autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in fibrin. Up to 2      additional treatments will be applied at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if your wound is      not healed.      Conventional Therapy - The subject will receive standard of care and accepted conventional      therapy, regardless of which of the three groups you will be randomized in. This standard of      care involves the use of dressings, bandages and protective ways to increase healing of your      wound.      Bone Marrow Aspirate - Depending on the treatment group that the subject is assigned to, they      will have either a bone marrow aspirate and/or sham (imitation) aspirate performed at this      visit.      Day 1 Treatment Visit:      All groups will receive the study treatment that was assigned at the randomization visit.      Wound measurements, clinical observations, wound dressings, adverse event reporting and      photography will be performed.      Weekly Follow-up Visits (Weeks 1-24):      All groups will return weekly for conventional therapy, wound measurements, clinical      observations, wound dressing changes, adverse event report, and photography. Two additional      study treatments will be given at Weeks 3 & 6 (+ or - 2 or 3 days) if the wound is not      healed.      Post-Treatment Follow-up Visit (Week 28):      All groups will return one month after 24 weeks of treatment for evaluation, wound      measurements, and photography.      Follow-up wound Biopsies:      Participants in all three study treatment groups will be asked to have an additional biopsy      of the wound edge at Week 6. This biopsy will only be taken if the wound has not healed.    ","

","      In this study, investigators aimed to transplant autologous, adipose tissue derived      mesenchymal stem cells to the patients with liver cirrhosis. Investigators also aimed to      assess liver tissue regeneration, downgrade of clinical findings and antiviral efficacy.      Finally investigators aimed to establish an alternative treatment modality to liver      transplantation.      Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) which can lead to chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an important health problem especially in western      countries. In 5% - 25 of patients with chronic HCV hepatitis who are nonresponders to current      medical treatment, liver cirrhosis develops. Approximately 1/3 of patients with liver      cirrhosis become decompensate in 10 years. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last      stage of the illness that leads to morbidity and mortality is difficult. Liver      transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis      due to chronic hepatitis C, However, serious problems are accompanied with liver      transplantation. Lack of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft      rejection and high costs are the main problems.      There are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a      diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called ""stem cells"". Stem cells can be      differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the      differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into hepatocytes is proved by      demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow      transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human      adipose tissue derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver      damage, differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes. Even though the number of      studies on human for the same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal      experiments. Some very recent studies emphasize the antiviral effects of MSCs. The reasons      for choosing this study title is; no available medical treatment for the non-responder      cirrhotic patients, shortage of organ donors, patients rapidly progressing to transplantation      candidates, and patients dying while they are in waiting lists and finally hopeful data      regarding MSC applications. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may      constitute new horizons in context of cellular therapies.      In this study autologous adipose tissue derived MSCs will be transplanted to patients with      liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C. After invitro expansion, patients will receive 1      million cells per kg. via peripheral vein every week for 3 times. Also via hepatic artery, 3      million cells per kg will be infused for 3 times in every 2 weeks. With this protocol,      investigators aimed to increase liver regeneration, decrease in liver fibrosis, increase the      waiting time of patients in transplantation lists and finally to establish a new and      regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver transplantation. For observation of      clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned to be monitored by pathology      examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month after the treatment, monthly      biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic examinations.

The study will be conducted in 4 sites in the United      States, including Emory University. A total of 480 participants will be enrolled in this      study.    ","      Primary osteoarthritis is a debilitating disease characterized by extensive damage to the      joints and excruciating pain leading to loss of activity and depression. Despite advances in      diagnosis and relatively efficient control of nociception, to date, the quest for the      development of a disease modifying osteoarthritis drug has proven unsuccessful. The potential      of mesenchymal stem cells to inhibit inflammation while promoting healing makes them amenable      for the treatment of various ailments ranging from cancer to genetic diseases. In orthopedic      practice, autologous stem cell injections are performed to alleviate the pain associated with      osteoarthritis. A serious gap in knowledge remains whether the currently used cellular      treatments are beneficial in the long term and if one cell therapy outperforms another.      The most popular form of Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC's) therapy has been through      the use of Autologous Bone Marrow Concentrate (BMAC). The rationale is that when a sample of      Bone Marrow Aspirate (BMA) is collected and the components that are not beneficial to the      joint are filtered out (i.e. red blood cells, neutrophils, etc.) the remaining concentrate      (MSC's, platelets, interleukins, etc) can have a ""healing"" effect on the environment in which      it is injected. However it is still unknown as to how effective BMAC is for treating      orthopedic conditions compared to other MSC procedures and the most important components of      the BMAC mixture that could aid patients suffering from osteoarthritis.      Adipose tissue has been found to have a large amount of mesenchymal stem cells versus that in      bone marrow. These cells are currently being used in a variety of clinical research studies      within the regenerative medicine field. Through a tissue process which includes washing and      centrifuging, the cellular components can be extracted as a cell pellet, which is also known      as Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF). Adipose derived SVF is obtained via liposuction, or the      removal of adipose tissue via a suction method.      Although the use of various stem cell preparations for knee osteoarthritis has become      increasingly prevalent, well-designed studies with conclusive proof of comparative      effectiveness and identification of the optimal cell source and ""dose"" have not been      performed. This study is the first randomized study comparing three types of cellular      treatments to corticosteroids. The main objective of the study is to identify a superior      source of stem cells for the treatment of osteoarthritis and validate its advantages over      corticosteroid injections as the traditional gold standard treatment.

The VAS-pain is self-completed by the participant. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line at the point that represents their pain intensity. Using a ruler, the score is determined by measuring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the ""no pain"" anchor and the participant's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. Pain will be assessed at rest and active movement of the affected joint. The recommended cut points for VAS are: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)., Change in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)Baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 monthsThe KOOS questionnaire is an instrument to assess the participant's opinion about their osteoarthritis and associated problems.

Standardized answer options are given (5 Likert boxes) and each question is assigned a score from 0 to 4. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale. A total lower score indicates more problems.

The EQ5D 3L survey measures five dimensions - mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The participants will be asked to answer questions regarding these measures and to indicate their current experience on a scale from 1 to 3 (1 being ""no problem"" and 3 being ""most extreme problem""). The answers to these question are put together to create a 5 digit composite score.This composite score will be indexed to a lookup table which produces a single summary score from 0 to 100. The respondents self-rate their level of severity for each dimension using three levels. The assessment will be done at baseline and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at 12 months.

Each of the seven domains has four questions which are scored on a five-point Likert scale. The PROMIS-29 scales will be scored using a T-score metric method available at the Assessment Center website (http://assessmentcenter.net). A score of 50 points represents the population average for each scale, and 10 points represent one standard deviation. Higher scores mean more of the specific scale's construct, which may indicate a desirable or an undesirable outcome.

","      Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common forms of arthritis. It is a lasting condition      in which the material that cushions the joints, called cartilage, breaks down. This causes      the bones to rub against each other, causing inflammation, stiffness, pain and loss of joint      movement. Currently, there are few effective treatments available for patients suffering from      OA.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that have the ability to self-regenerate, which means      they have the ability to make copies of themselves and to turn into other kinds of cells      (e.g. cartilage cells). Stem cell science shows much promise for the future treatment of      osteoarthritis, but much of the research is still in the early stages. In this study,      researchers want to determine the safety of MSCs that a patient can tolerate without causing      side effects.

To assess the efficacy of stromal vascular fraction (Autologous Non Expanded ADSC)           injection to patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.    ,"      Introduction:      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a disease of alarmingly increasing prevalence (8 - 16%)      associated with mortality [1]. CKD can progress towards end-stage renal disease (ESRD),      requiring renal replacement therapy. ESRD currently accounts for 6.3% of the Medicare      spending in the United States, and is projected to increase by 85% by 2015 [2]. In a study      conducted among rural population in Bangladesh overall CKD prevalence was found about 19%      [3]. Furthermore, ESRD has a major impact on quality of life and life expectancy [4].      Therefore, it is very important to develop therapeutic interventions to prevent, alleviate,      or decelerate progression of renal failure.      Diabetes mellitus and hypertension represent major causes of CKD and initiation of dialysis      [5]. In addition, glomerular diseases, malnutrition, infectious diseases, and acute kidney      injury may lead to ESRD, contributing to the increased global burden of death [6]. Current      treatment modalities often fail to target the major underlying contributors for progression      of renal disease [7]. Management of CKD at present mostly aims at control of the predisposing      factors and supplementation of kidneys homeostatic functions but not at the treatment of the      diseased kidney itself. Again due to lack of adequate facilities or financial constraints      people of a developing country like Bangladesh are unable to continue long term or lifelong      dialysis. Chronic glomerular and tubule-interstitial fibrosis is a common pathway to ESRD,      often associated with apoptosis, oxidative damage, fibrosis and microvascular rarefaction.      Unfortunately, the regenerative potential of kidney is limited under chronic conditions and      inefficient to prevent progressive glomerulosclerosis and tubule-interstitial fibrosis [8].      Treatment strategies that boost cellular regeneration might therefore offer good alternatives      for patients with CKD.      Stromal vascular fraction (SVF):      SVF of adipose tissue is a rich source of pre-adipocytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC),      endothelial progenitor cell, T cells, B cells, mast cells as well as adipose tissue      macrophages [9,10]. SVF is a component of the lipo-aspirate obtained from liposuction of      subcutaneous tissue. Lipo-aspirate contains a large population of stem cells called adipose      derived stem cells (ADSCs), which share a number of similarities with bone marrow stem cells,      including the capacity for multilineage differentiation .      Stem Cells:      A stem cell is a generic term referring to any unspecialized cell that is capable of      long-term self-renewal through cell division but that can be induced to differentiate into a      specialized, functional cell. Stem cells are generally two types, embryonic stem cells and      adult stem cells. Adult stem cells can be obtained from many differentiated tissues including      bone marrow, bone, fat, and muscle etc. Obtaining adult stem cells also does not raise any      ethical concerns [11]. For most studies, the adult stem cell in question is actually a      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cell. They are multipotent but not      pluripotent, which means they can differentiate into some, or ""multiple,"" but not all tissue      types [11]. Stem cells that are harvested from the patient with the intention of      administering them back to the same patient are termed autologous MSCs. MSC can also be      isolated from the bone marrow (bmMSC), peripheral blood, connective tissue, skeletal muscle,      dental pulp (dpMSC), umbilical cord wall (ucMSC), umbilical cord blood (cbMSC), amniotic      fluid (afMSC) and all have been used in experimental settings to treat various types of renal      diseases. An important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal      glomerular and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival [12].      Advantages of adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs):      ADSCs are somatic stem cell population contained in fat tissue and have been shown to possess      stem cell properties such as trans-differentiation and self-renewal [13]. Similar to other      types of MSCs, ADSCs express multiple CD marker antigens (CD73+CD90+CD105+ CD34+/- CD11b-      CD104b- CD19- CD31- CD45- SMA-) [14,15]. Additionally, utilizing ADSCs is advantageous in      that large quantities of stem cells are easily isolated using minimally invasive surgical      procedures [16].      ADSCs are vascular precursor cells. Many studies have shown that SVF contains progenitor      cells that are able to differentiate into endothelial cells and participate in blood vessel      formation [17]. Additionally, a recent study demonstrated that SVF cells expressing both      pericyte and mesenchymal markers reside in a peri-endothelial location and stabilize      endothelial networks [17] Another study showed that ADSCs transplanted into an ischemic renal      cortex preferentially migrate toward micro vessels where they differentiate into vascular      smooth muscle cells [18]. Some trials on kidney transplant recipients as well as the one on      FSGS and 2 on CKD patients include in their protocol the utilization of adMSC. Adipose tissue      is an important source of MSC, with a frequency 100 to 1000 times higher than bmMSC. They      also seem to possess a higher potential for angiogenesis or vasculogenesis [19].      Kidney disease and mesenchymal stem cells:      A number of different types of cells from the bone marrow have been tested in animals and in      clinical studies for potential use in kidney disease. Amongst all the cells under      investigation, MSCs have shown the most promising results to date as they help kidney cells      to grow, inhibit cell death and encouraging the kidney's own stem cells to repair kidney      damage [20].      Few clinical trials have tested safety and efficacy of MSCs for renal disease. Reinders and      colleagues studied safety and feasibility in six kidney allograft recipients who received two      intravenous infusions of expanded autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs [21]. Importantly,      delivery of autologous MSCs was not associated with adverse events, nor did it compromise      graft survival. Several clinical trials are currently underway to evaluate the therapeutic      potential of autologous and allogeneic MSCs for treatment of renal diseases [22]      Administration of both bmMSC and adMSC has demonstrated significant reno-protective effects      including reduction of intrarenal inflammatory infiltrate, decreased fibrosis, and      glomerulosclerosis [12] MSCs possess unique immunomodulatory properties that ameliorate      inflammation and immune responses, constituting a promising tool to facilitate renal repair.      In recent years, experimental studies have uncovered the potential of MSCs to improve renal      function in several models of CKD, and several clinical studies have indicated their safety      and efficacy in CKD [22].      ADSCs could be incorporated into damaged tissues or organs which could give rise to new      functional components and also exert potent anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, or      immunomodulation effects through paracrine or autocrine routes (via vascular endothelial      growth factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, stromal-derived      factor-1alpha and hepatocyte growth factor) [23,24]. Interestingly, it is proposed that even      apoptotic or dying ADSCs exhibit distinctive immunosuppressive properties [25]. ADSCs have      been shown to possess stronger anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating functions than bone      marrow derived MSCs [26].      Villanueva et al. explored the effect of ADSCs on CKD by a single intravenous infusion of      ADSCs on a nephrectomy induced CKD model of rats [27]. ADSC treatment was associated with      reduced plasma creatinine, higher levels of epitheliogenic and angiogenic proteins, and      improved renal function. Work by Hyun et al [28] illustrated the beneficial effects of ADSCs      on improving renal function on a IgAN mouse model. Zhang et al. [30] found that repeated      systemic administration of ADSCs attenuated proteinuria, glomerulus hypertrophy, and tubular      interstitial injury in a DN rat model [29].      Currently, several Clinical trials have been uploaded in the NIH database, all aim to test      mainly the safety of using MSC and their efficacy in treating CKD. Two of them propose the      use of autologous bmMSC and two adMSC. A study conducted in Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran,      which was designed to provide confirmation of Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in CKD. There 18      months safety and efficacy of autologous MSC as a therapy for CKD total of 10 patients were      conducted with I/V injection of high dose of 2x106/kg of autologous MSC. Assessments were      performed at 1,3,6,12 and 18 months after cell injections [30].      Another study conducted in Birmingham, Alabama, Rochester, Minnesota, Jackson, Mississippi,      USA where stem cell product called ""Mesenchymal stem cell"" grown from person's own fat tissue      infused back in to the patient's own kidney and primary outcome measured after 3 months where      renal tissue oxygenation increased and decrease in kidney inflammation was seen as secondary      outcome [31].      Route of delivery:      Various routes for delivery of ADSCs, ADSC-induced cells, or ADSCs combined with compound      materials have been developed for the treatment of different diseases or damaged tissue.      These routes can be classified into two categories: systemic delivery through blood vessels      (intravenous injection or intra-arterial injection) or local delivery directly into injured      tissues or organs [32] The route of MSC delivery may influence the cells' capacity to home      and engraft the damaged tissue, and thereby their efficacy for renal repair. Commonly used      experimental methods to deliver MSCs include systemic intravenous, intra-arterial, or      intra-parenchymal delivery. In nonhuman primates the cells distribute broadly into the      kidneys, skin, lung, thymus, and liver with estimated levels of engraftment ranging from 0.1      to 2.7% [33].      The route of MSC delivery, intravenous, intra-arterial, or intra-parenchymal, may affect      their efficiency for kidney repair. When labeled MSC intravenously infused into baboons were      observed for 9-21 months, estimated levels of engraftment in the kidney, lung, liver, thymus,      and skin ranged from 0.1-2.7% [34] Indeed, the intravenous route lags in delivery efficiency,      because MSC may initially be trapped in the lungs. Intra-arterial infusion of MSC was the      most effective route to achieve immunomodulation in rat kidney transplantation, possibly by      avoiding lodging in the pulmonary circulation, allowing MSC to home to the injured kidney      [35].      An important feature of MSCs is their capacity to induce proliferation of renal glomerular      and tubular cells, increasing cellular survival. By secreting proangiogenic and trophic      factors, injected MSCs not only can enhance proliferation, but also can decrease apoptosis of      tubular cells [36]. Several routes of administration (intra-parenchymal, sub-capsular,      intravenous) have been explored and all seem to be effective. Multiple, repeated injections      of MSCs appear to be even more effective than single injections [37,38].      Methodology:      A Prospective study from April 2019 onwards (Approximately Five years or till completion of      sample requirements with minimum one year of follow up) will be conducted in Bangladesh LASER      & Cell Surgery Institute & Hospital , Dhaka. 31 Patients of CKD who fulfill the selection      criteria and admitted at the selected health care facility for treatment will be included in      the study. SVF (stromal vascular fraction) will be collected from the abdominal subcutaneous      adipose tissue. Subsequent processing ( Incubation, centrifugation, mixing, washing &      neutralization ) will produce final viable & active SVF (ADSCs) cell which will be transfused      intravenously. Considering the possibility of further damage of the already damaging or      damaged kidney during angiography and placement of catheter into the renal artery, the      investigators opt for intra-venous transfusion of the SVF. Before transfusion sample will be      collected & cell counting will be done using automated fluorescent cell counter.    ",,"

","      Different types of stem cells have recently been studied in clinical trial on ischemic      disease of the heart and muscular arteries. Adipose derived stem cell, have shown in vitro      and in vivo models a stronger potential of success in recovering from ischemic disease and      oxygenation of the tissues. The investigators already shown in a phase I study, that adipose      derived mesenchymal cells injected in patients with critical limb ischemia and no option for      revascularization, had a very good tolerance and interesting effects on skin oxygenation and      healing.      The aim of the present clinical trial is to confirm the efficacy autologous transplantation      of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal cells in patients with critical limb ischemia with poor      options or no option for revascularization.    ","      Lower limbs arteries are a frequent localization of atheroma in elderly people (15-20% after      70 years). The most severe stage of the disease, critical limb ischemia (CLI), defined      clinically by the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer, has a dramatic prognosis at 12      months, with 30% of the patients alive with an amputation, 20% mortality and only 20% of      patients with a resolved disease, independently from the treatment. The only validated      treatment for this disease is revascularization by endovascular procedures or open surgery.      Patients with no option or poor option (high risk) for revascularization have the worst      prognosis.      Current research is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using different      sources of stem cells which can provide revascularization and oxygenation of the tissues. A      specific form of stem cells, called Adipose-derived Stem/Stroma Cells (ASC), has shown      promise for recovering from ischemic disease like critical limb ischemia (CLI) in preclinical      trial and trial in phase I. This study will confirm the efficacy autologous transplantation      of adipose tissue derived mesenchymal cells in patients with critical limb ischemia with poor      options or no option for revascularization.      This study is a phase II, prospective, multicentric, open trial and no comparative. A maximum      of 43 patients will be included in two-stage to receive 90*106 intramuscular injection of      ASC. Patients will be followed-up for 6 months.      The primary endpoint is the number of patients alive without major amputation and without      critical limb ischemia (defined as the presence of rest pain or ischemic ulcer and ankle      pressures less than 70 mmHg or toe systolic pressure less than 50 mmHg or TcPO2 of less than      30 mmHg, at six month).      The secondary endpoints are to evaluate:        -  the number of new vessels in the treated limb by standardized angiographic magnetic           resonance        -  the blood flow by laser Doppler, transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2), ankle           pressure        -  the percentage reduction of wound surface and percentage of complete ulcer healing        -  the pain reduction by standardized evaluation (visual scale and drug consumption)        -  the percentage of wound infection and irritative dermatitis (expected adverse events)        -  interleukin-1, interleukin-2, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-10,           interleukin-12, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFα)measurements in blood samples        -  Mesenchymal stem cells MSC trophic factors and immune- modulators (Hepatocyte growth           factor (HGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase           (IDO), Human Leucocyte Antigen G (HLA-G)) in vitro.

Several studies have shown that the immune system plays a significant role in the      pathogenesis of T2D. Bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and umbilical-cord      tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via its immunomodulatory properties have the      potential to improve insulin resistance condition and pancreatic beta-cells dysfunction thus      improve the glycemic control and insulin requirement in T2D patients.

",      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of intravenous infusion of autologous      bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) on brain structure and neurocognitive/functional      outcomes after severe traumatic brain (TBI) injury in adults. The primary objective is to      determine if the intravenous infusion of autologous BMMNC after severe TBI results in      structural preservation of global gray matter (GM) volume and white matter (WM) volume and      integrity; as well as select regions of interest in the corpus callosum. THe secondary      objectives are to determine if autologous BMMNC infusion improves functional and      neurocognitive deficits in adults after TBI; reduces the neuroinflammatory response to TBI;      evaluate spleen size and splenic blood flow over time using ultrasound and corresponding      changes in inflammatory cytokines; and infusion related toxicity and long-term follow-up      safety evaluations.    ,"      Traumatic brain injuries are associated with 33% of all trauma related deaths. There are no      effective therapies to treat secondary brain injury and the post-injury response of CNS      apoptosis and neuroinflammation. Pre-clinical and Phase I clinical progenitor cell therapies      have shown promise in TBI/stroke via (1) promotion of CNS structural preservation, and (2)      reducing the neuroinflammatory response to injury.      This is a multicenter, randomized, blinded, Bayesian CRM dose-escalation placebo-controlled      study designed to treat severe, acute TBI in adult patients with an IV infusion of autologous      bone marrow mononuclear cells. 55 adult TBI patients will be randomized to receive a single      IV infusion of BMMNs (6 x 10^6 or 9 x 10^6) or placebo.      Study subjects will be consecutive admissions of adults with severe TBI meeting      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Adults, ages 18-55 years, hospitalized at Memorial Hermann      Hospital (Houston, Texas) for severe TBI (GCS 3-8) will be screened for eligibility. Informed      consent, the bone marrow/sham harvest, and stem cell/placebo infusion must take place within      48 hours of the initial injury.      Following consent and baseline procedures, subjects will be randomized in a 3:2 ratio (using      permuted blocks and stratified by GCS of 3-4 or 5-8) to autologous BMMNC infusion (n=33) and      placebo (n = 22), respectively. Administration will begin with the lowest dose (i.e. 6 x 10^6      cells/kg body weight) with each dose given to cohorts of 3 subjects treated with BMMNC (note:      the cohort size refers only to subjects treated with autologous BMMNC). After each cohort of      3 subjects treated with autologous BMMNC infusion (accumulated on average after every 5.5      adults randomized), the dosage for the next cohort of 3 autologous BMMNC-treated subjects      will be determined by the CRM based on the findings for all subjects previously treated and      the prior probabilities of the likelihood of toxicity assigned by the investigators before      starting the study. At all doses, the algorithm is designed to avoid administering doses that      will have a p(toxicity) exceeding 0.15.      Subjects will be monitored closely for infusion related toxicity and complications during the      first 14 days post-infusion while also receiving the usual standard of care for traumatic      brain injury . Safety and outcome assessments will be performed at 1, 6, and 12 months      post-injury study visits.    ",,"

","      Study Title: A study to compare two articular cartilage repair techniques in the knee joint:      Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC) Vs. Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis      (MCIC).      Study hypothesis: We start with the hypothesis that both treatments are equally effective.      Trial Design: This is a prospective study. The participating patients will be divided into      two groups, each group receiving either one of the treatment modalities. This study will not      be randomised or blinded. Both procedures will be done at the Spire Alexandra Hospital by      Professor A. A Shetty, who is one half of the team that devised both techniques.      Trial Participants: All participants will be from patients attending Professor Shetty's      clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital.      Planned Sample Size: 50 patients in each arm.      Follow-up duration: The participating patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3      months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery by visits to the clinic and      assessed clinically. The surgical outcomes will be measured by by IKDC, KOOS and Lysholm      scores; cartilage growth will be measured by the MOCART score.      Planned Trial Period: Two to three years      Primary Objective: To establish superiority, if any, of either procedure over the other.      Primary Endpoint: At the end of the 2 year follow up for all participating patients.    ","      BACKGROUND: Articular cartilage repair in the knee is aimed at young patients with area(s) of      cartilage loss and no deformity of the knee. These patients aren't indicated for a knee      replacement. Articular cartilage repair leads to improvement of symptoms of pain, locking and      function. Traditionally, articular cartilage repair has always involved exposing the entire      knee joint with an arthrotomy. This, though effective, would lead to a large scar, longer      hospital stay, longer rehabilitation and its associated complications. Also, the use of Bone      Marrow Aspirate Cells (BMAC) for the purpose of cartilage repair has long been debated with      both sides having valid arguments and good surgical results.      RATIONALE: Both procedures in this study are performed in one stage, arthroscopically and as      day case procedures, which offers minimal scarring and quicker recovery. This automatically      confers a significant advantage over the traditional surgical techniques.      To correct the articular cartilage defect, the ACIC method requires autologous Atellocollagen      (a protein based structure), while the MCIC method uses concentrated BMAC taken from the      patient's iliac crest.      Both procedures have shown encouraging results in terms of pain relief, cartilage growth and      improved function. Since one technique utilises a protein based reagent and the other      involves mesenchymal cells, this study aims to ascertain if either technique is superior to      the other.      STUDY DESIGN: This study aims to compare two techniques of articular cartilage repair in the      knee, namely Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC) and Mesenchymal Cell Induced      Chondrogenesis (MCIC). The principal objective of is to ascertain and assess the superiority,      if any, of either surgical technique over the other. The superiority will be assessed with by      the certain scoring systems (IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm and MOCART) measured pre- and      post-operatively.      Depending on which procedure the patient chooses to have, they will be allotted to either the      ACIC or the MCIC group. The patient is followed up in the clinic at the Spire Alexandra      Hospital at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery      and their progress is documented by questionnaires and clinical examination. MRI scans are      done at one and two years to assess the extent of cartilage growth.      SURGICAL TECHNIQUES      Autologous Collagen Induced Chondrogenesis (ACIC):      ACIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure. It is done as a day case? procedure and the      patient is admitted a few hours before the procedure. The anaesthetic method depends is the      Anaesthesiologist's prerogative and depends on the patient's general health. Under sterile      conditions in an operating theatre, the arthroscopic instruments are introduced inside the      knee joint. As assessed previously by MRI scans, the area of cartilage defect is debrided by      curettage, shaving and burring and then microfractured. The ACIC method utilises autologous      Atellocollagen, a protein based structure, mixed with thrombin and fibrinogen to form a gel      which coats the area with a cartilage defect. The entry ports are then closed and the knee is      covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is transferred to the surgical recovery ward      and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the ward.      After discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the      operated leg for 6 weeks after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy.      Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.      Mesenchymal Cell Induced Chondrogenesis (MCIC):      MCIC is a single stage arthroscopic procedure.

","      Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment      that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach      includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune      modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so      far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's      survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible for      lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally      succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for      more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to      represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be      easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung diseases,      including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.      Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment      option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be      developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment      adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new      opportunities for development of the same.      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules      involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to      mesenchymal tissue.14      As limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients      hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been      undertaken to explore the tolerability & effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC in      second treatment arm in IPF patients.      Adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in      preclinical studies to be safe and effective    ","      Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained      from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes,      endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs).      In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells.      These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast      cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells and endothelial progenitor cells,      to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor beta      (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), among      others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an extracellular      matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose tissue      extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in neural      regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be carried      out in cGMP compliance clean room.      Pure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial      eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.      Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are      present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the      nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs can      be expanded in vitro ≥ 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into several      mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation, High      expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to      isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles,      Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control      and release criteria.      Beside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used      allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have      positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex vivo,      and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous      population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the ability      to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, even      when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of differentiating      into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in semisolid medium      and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to mesodermal lineages but      also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like endothelial could be realized in      vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud mesoderm (osteoblasts,      chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and can also differentiate      into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can facilitate vasculogenesis by      increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. After MSCs are intramyocardially      injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise, vascular density and regional blood      flow increases, and contractility improves.      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules      involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to      mesenchymal tissue.

",      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous Adipose      Tissue derived Mesenchymal stem cells (JOINTSTEM®) in patient with severe Knee      Osteoarthritis.    ,"      JOINTSTEM is injectables for an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal      stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is cultured without additional genetic      modification, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of      immunologic rejection.      It primarily aims to improve joint function. The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is      expected to stimulate the regeneration of cartilage, and to innovatively improve joint      function with cartilage regeneration.      The subjects of this therapy were patients with K&L grade 3 aged 20 or older.      This study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study with two arms to evaluate      JOINTSTEM as a treatment for subjects with osteoarthritis. Following a 2-week screening      period, approximately 260 patients will be randomly assigned into one of the following two      arms in a 1:1 ratio (1 JointStem : 1 placebo control). After each patient completes 6-month      visit (Visit 5) and the data management team confirms all data have no issue, the individual      database will be locked and the blinding will be open for the statistical analysis.

","      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic systemic disease, which is characterized by chronic      inflammation in the synovial tissue. Rheumatoid arthritis ultimately results in the      destruction of cartilage, bone and ligaments and joint deformity. The underlying hypothesis      is that autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal and specific populations of stem cells has      anti-inflammatory and regenerative effects and thus potentially alleviates the progression of      rheumatoid arthritis. The study is to explore the safety and efficacy of BM-SC      transplantation in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.    ","      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It      typically results in swollen and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen after rest.      Most frequently, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on      both sides of the body. RA affects between 0.5-1% of adults in the developed world with      between 5-50 per 100,000 people newly developing the disease each year. Onset is most      frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. The goal of      treatment is to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall      functioning and quality of life.      Herein, the investigators study the safety and efficacy of the immunomodulatory effects of      bone marrow-derived stem cells administered intravenously and the regenerative and repair      potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells transplanted into the joints of patients with RA.

","      Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease, mainly characterized by cutaneous and      visceral fibrosis. Digital ulcer and sclerosing skin are commonly affected on hands, but the      treatment for these manifestations are often ineffective.      Adipose tissue contains stromal vascular fraction (SVF), which is abundant multipotent stem      cells, capable of tissue repair. A prior study (NCT01813279) has shown the safety and      tolerance at 6 months of the subcutaneous injection of SVF in the fingers in SSc.      There are only few ways to manage SSc patients with skin lesion who already have treated with      several medications (including vasodilators, PDE5 inhibitor, endothelin receptor antagonist)      but some times their skin lesions are critical physically and emotionally.      Autologous SVF injection could be one of the treatment options to treat skin lesion of SSc.      Thus, the investigators study the efficacy and potential adverse event in Korean patients      with SSc.

","      Heart attacks are a leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. When a      person has a heart attack, blood is unable to reach a certain area of the heart, and if the      blood supply is not re-established quickly, that area of the heart can suffer permanent      damage. While recovery from a heart attack can be managed through medications and lifestyle      changes, these treatments can not reverse the original damage to the heart. Current research      is focusing on the development of cell-based therapies using stem cells to repair organs that      have been irreversibly damaged by disease. A specific form of stem cells, called adult      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown promise for heart repair. This study will evaluate      the safety and effectiveness of injecting MSCs into the heart to repair and restore heart      function in people who have had a heart attack and who are having heart surgery for coronary      artery bypass grafting (CABG).    ","      Participation in this study will last 18 months. Potential participants will undergo initial      screening 5 to 7 weeks prior to CABG surgery. Screening will include a physical exam, blood      draw, pregnancy test, questions about medical history, current medications, and alcohol or      drug use, an electrocardiogram (ECG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart,      questionnaires, an echocardiogram and a computed tomography (CT) scan. Eligible participants      will then undergo two baseline visits within 6 weeks of their scheduled surgery. Baseline      Visit 1 will consist of vital sign measurements, a bone marrow aspiration to obtain MSCs and      a blood draw for a biomarker test. Baseline Visit 2 will include treadmill test, 6-minute      walk test, pulmonary function (FEV1) study and a 48 Hour Ambulatory ECG. After the second      baseline visit, participants will be assigned randomly to receive either MSCs or placebo      after surgery.      On the day of surgery, once all of the bypass grafts have been placed, a high or low dose of      MSCs or placebo will be injected into a damaged area of the heart that did not receive a      bypass graft. After receiving the injections, participants will remain in the hospital for up      to 7 days. During this stay, participants will undergo a daily blood draw, urine test, ECG,      and ambulatory ECG monitoring for the first 96 hours after surgery.      Upon being discharged, participants will return for monthly visits for 6 months and for      follow-up visits 12 and 18 months after surgery. These visits will repeat most initial      screening and baseline tests. There will be one additional visit 14 days after surgery, which      will include questions about side effects, a physical exam, and a 48-hour ambulatory ECG.    ","

","      Limb-length discrepancy can be due to many causes. These are divided into three groups:      congenital (from birth), developmental (from a childhood disease or injury that slows or      damages the growth plates), and posttraumatic (from a fracture that leads to shortening of      the bone ends). There are three ways to equalize the limb-length discrepancy: use a shoe      lift, shorten the long leg, lengthen the short leg. Most patients do not like wearing a lift      greater than 2 cm (3/4 in). For discrepancies greater than 2 cm but less than 5 cm (2 in),      shortening of the long leg can be considered, especially for tall persons. For growing      children, this can be easily accomplished with a small, minimally invasive, uncomplicated      procedure called epiphysiodesis.The investigators aim to evaluate if injection of bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stem cells can shorten the treatment period by acceleration of bone      regeneration during distraction osteogenesis.    ","      Distraction osteogenesis has been widely utilized to treat leg length discrepancy, deformity,      nonunion, osteomyelitis, and bone loss. It has been found that most difficult conditions can      be resolved with this method. In this study the aim is to observe if mesenchymal stem cell      transplantation can enhance new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis.Patients      undergo bone distraction , and about 2-3 weeks after distraction mesenchymal stem cell are      injected at the callus site. In the case of large bone gap, mesenchymal stem cells are seeded      on bone matrix and then placed in the bone gap. Each patient is assessed at interval time of      1 month for 6 months post surgery by X-Ray and at month 6 post surgery by computed      tomography(CT) scans.    ",,"

","      This is an open label, single arm, single center investigation to assess the safety and      efficacy of purified adult autologous bone marrow derived CD34+, CD133+, and mesenchymal stem      cells injected into the seminiferous tubules and testis, through a 12 week follow-up period.      The investigators' selected model of research is based on maximizing the efficiency of the      approach by choosing an autologous pattern which preserves the genetic make-up of an      individual that is vital in infertility conditions. Additionally the approach involves      injecting a combination of different but purified cell types which all aid in the retrieval      of spermatogenesis, and the generation of mature spermatozoa. Expected outcomes of this study      are defined in general improvements in infertile patients in regards of testicular      morphology, sexual function, semen quality, development of primary or secondary      spermatocytes, spermatids, or mature spermatozoa in the testis, seminiferous tubules, or      semen.    ","      Non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) is generally considered a non-medically manageable cause of      male infertility. These patients, who constitute up to 10% of all infertile men, have      abnormal spermatogenesis as the cause of their azoospermia. The etiology affecting      approximately 60% of azoospermic men, includes non-obstructive causes of azoospermia,      including toxic exposures or abnormal testicular development. NOA results from either primary      testicular failure (elevated Luteinizing Hormone (LH), Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),      small testes affecting up to 10% of men presenting with infertility), secondary testicular      failure (congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with decreased LH and FSH, small testes),      or incomplete or ambiguous testicular failure (either increased FSH and normal volume testes,      normal FSH and small testes, or normal FSH and normal testis volume). Prior to microsurgical      testicular sperm retrieval techniques and IVF/ICSI, donor insemination was the only option      available to men with NOA. The establishment of in vitro fertilization using intracytoplasmic      sperm injection (ICSI) as a standard treatment modality has resulted in a number of these men      successfully fathering a child through surgically retrieved sperm from the testis. The      challenge, however, is to improve their spermatogenic function to enable the appearance of      sperm in their ejaculate or to improve the chances of a successful retrieval from the testis      for ICSI.      The initial evaluation aims at resolving the following issues: (1) confirming azoospermia,      (2) differentiating obstructive from non-obstructive etiology, (3) assessing for the presence      of reversible factors and (4) evaluating for the presence of genetic abnormalities. An      elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level or an absence of normal spermatogenesis by      testicular histology in the presence of azoospermia is generally considered sufficient      evidence of a non-obstructive etiology. The most common reversible factors that need to be      ruled out include recent exogenous hormone administration, severe febrile illnesses,      chemotherapy/radiation or prolonged antibiotic use.      During past few years a considerable progress in the derivation of male germ cells from      pluripotent stem cells has been made. These studies provide a desirable experimental model      for elucidating underlying molecular mechanism of male germ cell development and potential      strategies for producing haploid germ cells for the treatment of male infertility.      Spermatogenesis is a complex process by which spermatogonial stem cells (SSC) self-renew and      differentiate into haploid spermatozoa. In mammals, this process takes place in the      seminiferous tubules of testis, which provide a functional niche for male germ cells and      involve three major stages: mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. Errors at any stage of      spermatogenesis can result in subfertility and infertility.      Researchers are currently developing alternative treatment options for these men involving      stem cells. It has been verified that mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can form      functional spermatozoa. Functional assays have shown that spermatozoa generated from iPSCs      were capable of fertilizing the oocytes after intracytoplasmatic injection and giving rise to      fertile offspring following embryo transfer. So far, functional male gametes from human iPSCs      have not been obtained.      There are two possible approaches in generating of male germ cells from pluripotent stem      cells: in vitro differentiation into advanced, haploid cell products or combined in vitro      differentiation and in vivo transplantation. However, the originality of this study is      illustrated in the transplantation of purified autologous CD34+/CD133+ and mesenchymal bone      marrow stem cells (BMSCs) into infertile patients without in vitro breeding, culture, or      manipulation thus avoiding in vitro cell propagation risks as genetic mutations and DNA      changes. The cells are withdrawn and injected back into the patient on the very same day of      the procedure, hence conferring the highest safety and efficacy parameters.    ",,"

The main objective is to determine the effect of the administration of autologous mesenchymal      cells of the bone marrow by intramyocardial injection on myocardial perfusion in cardiac      transplant patients with severe coronary vasculopathy.    ","      MES-HT is a phase 1-2 multicenter pilot prospective study conducted on 14 heart transplant      patients who developed severe coronary vasculopathy, in the aim to assess the effect on      myocardial perfusion of the intramyocardial administration by percutaneous way of autologous      mesenchymal stem cells derived from the bone marrow.      The main objective is to show improvement in myocardial perfusion in a non-randomized and      uncontrolled pilot study, before considering a randomized controlled study. The      administration of intra myocardial cells using the NOGA system was carried out to date with      more than 1,000 patients and is considered feasible and safe. However, the investigators will      assess very carefully the feasibility and safety of this invasive approach.      The primary endpoint is the improvement of myocardial perfusion measured by MRI after      endomyocardial injection of mesenchymal cells by percutaneous way, guided by the NOGA system.      The secondary endpoints are the feasibility and safety of this administration, changes in      ejection fraction measured by contrast echocardiography, changes in other MRI cardiac      parameters (left ventricular volumes , intramyocardial fibrosis), the oxygen consumption      during exercise, myocardial perfusion measured by SPECT. Other secondary endpoints are the      evolution of the immune status, and histological criteria of myocardial biopsy.      Once the mapping performed, preparation is injected through another catheter (MYOSTAR      injection catheter) which will also be guided by the Noga® system. This catheter may be      positioned on the regions of interest (viable ischemic areas) and allow the injection of the      quantity of CSM (40 million / ml) in 10 to 12 different injection points and injection      volumes 0.3 ml for a total dose of 120 to 144 million cells.      After each injection procedure, patients are monitored for 48 hours minimum clinically and      under continuous ECG monitoring to detect possible arrhythmias. A troponin dosage is done      after 6 H, and after 24 and 48 hours. An echocardiogram is performed immediately after the      procedure and before the release to 48 H.      A clinical evaluation will be made after the patient is discharged at 1 month (clinical      examination + Holter + echocardiography), 3 months (examination), 6 months (clinical      examination, Holter, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, test of effort with measurement of VO2,      effort myocardial tomoscintigraphy and for patients from Pitie-Salpetriere hospital, Rubidium      82 by positron emission tomography) and 12 months (examination). Myocardial biopsy and a      control coronary angiography will be only performed within 12 months in accordance with the      practice of the teams.      Patients will benefit from a biological monitoring which provides for the monitoring of      immune response. This immuno-monitoring is to assess the possible influence of the injection      of mesenchymal cells on immunological tolerance mechanisms. It will be implemented in the      balance sheets of cardiac tissue at the waning annual biopsies and peripheral blood samples      on inclusion, 48 hours after injection and at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.      The limiting toxicity is defined as the occurrence at one month of a serious adverse effect      related to the protocol , requiring an hospitalization or being able to be life-threatening ,      or like abundant pericardial effusion requiring pericardial drainage, bleeding complications      requiring blood cell transfusion or surgery, stroke constituted, sepsis or septic shock,      cardiogenic shock, severe ventricular rhythm refractory death.

",      Gene transfer for ADA-SCID using an improved lentiviral vector (TYF-ADA)    ,"      This clinical trial will evaluate a safety and efficiency improved lentiviral vector system      for delivering a therapeutic gene to patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)      due to a defective adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. This gene encodes for the adenosine      deaminase enzyme, which is essential for the proper growth and function of infection-fighting      white blood cells called T and B lymphocytes. Patients who lack this enzyme are vulnerable to      frequent and severe infections.      ADA-SCID patients are normally rescued by a bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a matched      healthy donor. However, matched donors are difficult to find and donor BMT is associated with      high risk. This trial aims to treat ADA-SCID using a safety and efficiency improved      self-inactivating lentiviral vector carrying a functional ADA gene to correct the genetic      defect. By collecting an individual's stem cells and modifying them with a lentivirus, the      gene-corrected cells can be returned to the patient to help produce normal healthy immune      cells.The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the improved self-inactivating      lentiviral vector TYF-ADA, the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of      immune reconstitution in patients overcoming frequent infections present at the time of      treatment. We will assess the lentiviral gene integration sites and the long-term effect of      this gene transfer procedure.    ",,"

","      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system      (CNS), which ultimately leads to myelin damage and axonal loss. The disease is complex and      multifactorial, but the key pathogenic event appears to be an uncontrolled response of      components of the immune system (T and B lymphocytes) to myelin proteins. No definitive      treatment is available for MS, however immunomodulatory and immunosuppressant drugs act as      disease-modifying agents (DMDs).      Unfortunately, the current treatments demonstrate partial efficacy in targeting the      deleterious immune reactions. According to the present knowledge of the pathophysiology of      MS, an ideal therapeutic strategy would be to modulate or suppress the aggressive immune      process, to protect axons and neurons from degeneration, and to enhance repair and facilitate      remyelination.      A specific form of stem cells, called adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), has shown      remarkable ability to modulate the immune response. This study will evaluate the safety of      injecting MSCs in people with MS.    ","      MSCs have the remarkable ability to modulate the immune response mainly by inhibiting      proliferation of T cells and to protect injured tissues through paracrine mechanisms. There      is an urgent need to evaluate the real efficacy of MSC transplantation, and its possible      position in the current therapeutic armamentarium. An international panel of MS neurology and      stem cell experts, as well as immunologists formed an ""International Mesenchymal Stem Cells      Transplantation"" (MSCT) Study Group with the aim to derive a consensus on what cells should      be used for transplantation and develop a treatment protocol and an experimental program that      will eventually attest to the efficacy of MSC transplantation and understand the mechanism      that underlie the benefit. 12 patients with MS will be treated with IV injections of      autologous isolated and expanded mesenchymal stem cells. Clinical and objective evaluations      will be performed at baseline and during 12 months follow-up.    ","

",      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial of gene therapy for treating Fanconi anemia using a      self-inactivating lentiviral vector to functionally correct the defective gene. The      objectives are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the gene transfer clinical protocol.    ,"      Fanconi anemia is a rare, inherited disease that is caused by a gene defect and that      primarily affects an individual's bone marrow, resulting in decreased production of blood      cells. The major problem for most patients is aplastic anemia, the blood counts for red blood      cells, white blood cells, and platelets are low. In addition, some patients have physical      defects usually involving the skeleton and kidneys. Fanconi anemia is typically diagnosed in      childhood, and there is a high fatality rate. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)      is a common treatment for Fanconi anemia. However, there are many risks associated with HSCT      including rejection of the transplanted cells and graft-versus-host disease.      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety of the self-inactivating lentiviral vector,      the ex vivo gene transfer clinical protocol and the efficacy of immune reconstitution in      patients overcoming immune abnormalities present at the time of treatment, assessment of gene      correction efficiency, and finally the long-term correction of Fanconi anemia associated      disease symptoms.

","      Treatment of isolated osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint at the initial stages involves      the use of numerous conservative or arthroscopic treatments with uncertain results and, upon      their failure, the current solution for the resolution of symptoms is shoulder arthroplasty,      an effective procedure but with significant costs and rates of morbidity, especially in young      patients. Since the use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal cells obtained from the      bone marrow has proved effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis, our goal is to evaluate      the effectiveness of the same therapy in the treatment of glenohumeral arthritis isolated.    ","      Glenohumeral arthritis is one of the main reasons for persistent shoulder pain and reduced      movement (range of motion, ROM) as it can compromise the work activity and also the normal      daily activities, leading to the development of depressive syndromes. The final treatment is      shoulder arthroplasty, which is effective but is associated with significant costs and      morbidity rates. In addition, arthro-prosthesis is avoided in young patients due to longevity      concerns and is not indicated in the early stages of arthritis. Currently, conservative      treatments for patients with mild or moderate glenohumeral arthritis include non-steroidal      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroid injections, with low efficacy and a      significant adverse effect profile, hyaluronic acid infiltrations, with good efficacy in      initial treatment, and infiltrations of platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), which have shown      beneficial effects in knee arthritis. However, evidence for the glenohumeral joint are      limited. In cases not responsive to conservative therapy, and especially in young patients, a      valid alternative to the prosthesis is the arthroscopic treatment, with good results in the      short term, but with relatively high failure rates that increase over time. Other types of      nonprosthetic surgical treatment for chondral-humeral defects have low scientific evidence,      with variable and uncertain results. In recent years, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), derived      from bone marrow or adipose tissue, due to the ability to differentiate into chondrogenic      line cells, have emerged as cells with great therapeutic potential in patients with      degenerative joint disorders. Since the knee joint is the most susceptible to pathology      because of its mechanical load, most studies based on stem cell therapy regard the knee      joint, reporting promising results in treatment in the treatment of early stages of      arthritis. As regards the glenohumeral joint, since the most frequent pathology affects the      tendons of the rotator cuff, almost all studies investigate the effect of MSC in the      treatment of rotator cuff disorders with or without associated surgical repair techniques.      Only a prospective study analyzed the effect of intra-articular MSC injection derived from      bone marrow in 34 patients with isolated glenohumeral arthritis, reporting a significant      decrease in pain and an improvement in shoulder function measured by the Disabilities of the      Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale at about 1 year, although study quality is very low.      Since the use of intra-articular injections of mesenchymal cells obtained from the bone      marrow has proved effective in the treatment of gonarthrosis, our study proposes to evaluate      the long-term efficacy of this type of therapy in the treatment of the isolated glenohumeral      arthritis.

","      The proposed research study aims to evaluate the effects of autologous bone marrow aspirate      concentrate (BMAC) on the development and progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in patients      undergoing meniscectomy. This prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial will      compare patient-reported outcomes, specifically IKDC scores between patients who receive BMAC      post-meniscectomy and those who receive a saline control injection. The study will also      compare physical examination, MRI, radiographs, and synovial fluid analysis. Our hypothesis      is that those who receive the autologous BMAC injection after the procedure will have better      outcomes than those who do not.    ","      Recent studies have demonstrated both the safety of BMAC intra-articular injection and      improvements in subjective, patient reported outcomes in patients with existing knee OA.      Unfortunately these studies were largely uncontrolled, underpowered, and/or retrospective in      nature. Additionally, a recent prospective, randomized clinical study of allograft      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) injected at a separate time point post surgical intervention      has highlighted the ability of MSCs to increase meniscal volume and improve knee pain      following injection.      This will be the first study to examine the effects of autograft BMAC intra-articular      injection in a single-stage procedure and in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion.      The results of this study, if the null hypothesis is rejected, will have far-reaching      implications for the standard of care in meniscal treatment and on OA progression in the      knee. Additionally, if the results of this study are favorable in reduction of OA progression      this study will change the surgical approach to all axial, synovial joints including the      shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, and ankle.

","      Early reperfusion strategies in tandem with remarkable advances in drugs and devices for      treating myocardial infarction (MI) have contributed to a reduction in early mortality, but      cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Current management      strategies cannot solve the problem of cardiomyocyte loss and consequent progression of heart      failure. In this respect, stem-cell therapy has shown potential benefits for repairing the      damaged myocardium. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been considered to be attractive      therapeutic candidates because of their high capacity for replication: paracrine effect:      ability to preserve potency: and because they do not cause adverse reactions to allogeneic      versus autologous transplants. Intracoronary injection of stem cells seems to be safe, but      only one clinical trial using MSCs via the intracoronary route in the setting of acute      myocardial infarction (AMI) has been carried out. The investigators therefore assessed the      safety and efficacy of intracoronary autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived human MSCs in      patients with AMI.    ",,,"

",      The purpose of this study is to improve the blood glucose level in type 2 diabetic patients.    ,"      We hypothesize that Autologous bone marrow derived stem cells which would be expanded into      culture and their subsequent transplant into the pancreas of patients with T2DM, aged 30 - 70      years with triple oral hypoglycemic agent failure and on insulin(>0.4 U/ kg body weight/day)      will lead to abolition or reduction of insulin requirement by more than or equal to 50% in      these patients over a period of 6 months. It is assumed that stem cell in these patients      leads to increased angiogenesis, secretion of various cytokines and upregulation of      pancreatic transcription factors and Vascular endothelial growth factor(VEGF) and creates a      micro-environment which supports beta cell/resident stem cell activation and survival.
