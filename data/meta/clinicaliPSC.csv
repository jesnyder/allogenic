","      The aim of this study is to determine the contribution of genetic factors to the pathogenesis      of diseases, including diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Hirschsprung's disease, and      autism. Patient-derived cellular models of diseases will be developed, which will require the      collection of blood samples from patients and healthy individuals in order to generate      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of iPSC-derived human cell      cultures. These human cellular models will be phenotyped using a variety of methods,      including cellular, molecular, and biochemical assays. Because these human cellular models      will retain the genetic background from the patients and control subjects, this will allow us      to determine the contribution of genetics to disease phenotypes. Such disease-specific      pluripotent stem cell lines will be invaluable tools for many basic and translational      research applications, including pathophysiological studies in a developmental context, and      innovation and screening of small molecule drugs capable of reversing the disease phenotype      and potentially leading to a cure for a broad range of diseases, where appropriate in vitro      or in vivo disease models do not exist.

Neonates can present with ascites and severe liver disease from      infiltration of the liver and/or respiratory failure from infiltration of the lungs. Other      infants, without liver or pulmonary disease, have hypotonia and developmental delay. The      classic presentation occurs in mid-to-late childhood with the insidious onset of ataxia,      vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and dementia. Dystonia and seizures are common. Dysarthria      and dysphagia eventually become disabling, making oral feeding impossible; death usually      occurs in the late second or third decade from aspiration pneumonia. Adults are more likely      to present with dementia or psychiatric symptoms. The diagnosis of NPC is confirmed by      biochemical testing that demonstrates impaired cholesterol esterification and positive      filipin staining in cultured fibroblasts. Biochemical testing for carrier status is      unreliable. Most individuals with NPC have NPC1, caused by mutations in the NPC1 gene; fewer      than 20 individuals have been diagnosed with NPC2, caused by mutations in the NPC2 gene.      Molecular genetic testing of the NPC1 genes detects disease-causing mutations in      approximately 94% of individuals with NPC. Such testing is available clinically.      NPC is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The phenotype (i.e., age of onset and      severity of symptoms) usually runs true in families. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives      and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible when the two      disease-causing mutations have been identified in the family.      Though NPC is a pan-ethnic disorder, the prevalence of this autosomal-recessive disorder is      elevated in countries with a higher frequency of consanguinity.      Therefore, the goal of the study to prepare a cell culture from patients affected with      Niemann Pick disease in order to identify novel pathways and proteins involved in disease      progression that allow for an earlier diagnosis (i.e. before symptom onset) and that are      suitable targets for an individualized therapeutic approach able to address not only the      hepatic form, but also the neurologic form of the disease, which is less responsive to the      current therapeutic approaches.

To derive neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons from iPSCs of ASD probands and           healthy controls and compare differences between patients and healthy controls to           investigate the cellular phenotype of ASD and uncover the pathophysiology of the           disease.    ,"      Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is a common, lifelong impairing childhood-onset      neurodevelopmental disorder with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The etiology of ASD is      complicated and remains largely unknown. Evidences indicate the high heritability (54-77%) in      ASD, and researchers also found copy number variations (CNVs) play an important role in the      etiology of ASD. However, due to the ethical issue, researchers haven't had an appropriate      platform to investigate the copy number change effect to date. In the following study,      researchers are going to derive ASD-specific induced pluripotent stem cells and neurons for      disease modeling.      10 ASD patients and 10 healthy controls will be included in the present study and iPSCs and      neurons will be generated from their PBMCs. Electrophysiological recording and analysis of      neuronal morphology will be conducted to reveal the cellular phenotype of ASD after comparing      differences between patients and healthy controls.      The study will provide a platform to reveal the etiology of genetic basis and molecular      mechanism of ASD. The cellular phenotype of ASD will be revealed by comparing differences      between patients and healthy controls. The findings from this work are expected to contribute      to the basic and clinical research on ASD.    ",,"

","      The objective of this study research proposal is to model human gliomagenesis using      3-Dimensional (3D) brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells      (hiPSCs).      The working hypothesis is that 3D brain organoids can develop glioma-like structures and      recapitulate phenotypic traits of gliomas when generated from hiPSCs expressing genetic      mutants associated with glioma predisposition.      Methodology : To develop this pioneer study on the use of hiPSC-based brain organoids as a      strategy to model gliomagenesis and study the impact of genetic mutants, it will be collect      the peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 20 patients with high grade astrocytoma with or      without IDH mutation. iPS will be generated from these PBMC and will be genetically modified      according to different mutations. Then, it will be generate brain organoids according to      standard protocols. Brain organoids generated from all different cells will be collected at      different time points and analyzed for the presence of glioma-like structures and phenotypic      hallmarks of gliomas.      From the proposed experiments, it will be expect that brain organoids will develop      glioma-like features upon the presence of genetic mutations. Thus, it will be expect to      demonstrate that brain organoids can be used as a reliable strategy to test the impact of      genetic mutants, including the possible synergistic cooperation between different mutations      on early gliomagenic events.

","      Recent advances have shown that cells from human blood, skin and urine samples can be      reprogrammed to become stem cells. These are called induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)      and share many characteristics with embryonic stem cells, including an unlimited capacity for      proliferation and the potential to become any cell in the body. Beneficially, the use of      iPSCs avoids the ethical difficulties which surround embryonic stem cells and allows      generation of iPSC lines which are disease representative. For example, we could take skin      samples from an individual diagnosed with Huntington's disease and their unaffected sibling      and using this technology, generate iPSC lines from both individuals. Using these iPSCs, we      could produce disease affected cell populations from the affected and unaffected individuals,      use these cells to research why specific cell populations are affected by disease and test      new treatments to combat disease progression, essentially producing a 'disease in a dish'.      This is just one example of many for which this technology could be applied. We can also      utilise gene-editing techniques to generate isogenic controls or insert disease related      mutations to assess disease phenotype.      Although generation of iPSC lines has been robustly proven across multiple disease      backgrounds, many aspects of their downstream use still remain to be determined.      Particularly, robust protocols for directing iPSCs towards cell fates such as neurons or      blood cells must be developed to fully realise application of iPSCs in disease modelling and      drug screening.      This study involves the collection of human blood, skin or urine samples from subjects      bearing a range of genetic diseases alongside those from individuals who have not been      diagnosed with a disease, as controls. These samples will be used to generate iPSC lines for      development of differentiation and disease phenotyping protocols.    ","      Recent advances in biotechnology have shown that somatic cells (such as skin, blood and urine      cells) from human adults and children can be reprogrammed to change their characteristics and      become other types of cells that may be useful for disease modelling and drug screening. This      includes the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) which can be derived      from these somatic cells by a process known as ""cellular reprogramming"". These iPSCs share      many characteristics with embryonic stem cells, including an unlimited capacity for      proliferation and the potential to differentiate into any cell of the body. However, unlike      embryonic stem cells, the generation of iPSCs avoids the practical and ethical difficulties      of obtaining embryonic tissues. Consequently, cellular reprogramming and iPSC technology has      great implications in the field of disease modelling and drug screening.      Many obstacles must be overcome before iPSC based disease modelling and drug screening can      fully be realised and allow replacement of inadequate animal models and simplistic cell      models. This study will enable us to gather samples from a range of participants from      different disease backgrounds, and to develop suitable panels of iPSCs for the purpose of      protocol development. Development of robust protocols which are suitable for use across      multiple iPSC lines and repeatable across multiple laboratories are essential for the use of      iPSCs in disease modelling and drug screening. This study will allow us to look at causation      of disease across a range of disease specific cell lines with known genetic backgrounds which      are representative of a cohort of human patients. This is fundamental for development of iPSC      based drug screening assays.    ",,"

","Number of disease relevant iPSC differentiation protocols generated within the study2 yearsThe primary research question is to determine if and how we can use iPSCs to improve modelling of genetic diseases, particularly in generating iPSC-derived, disease relevant, tissue specific cell populations. Currently, research into the pathology and progression of genetic diseases and subsequent development of therapeutics is heavily dependent on the use of simplistic cell models and/or animal models which are poorly representative of the human disease. Although generation of iPSC lines has been observed across many disease backgrounds, a number of facets of their downstream use still remain to be determined. To fully exploit the possibilities of iPSCs, it is critical to develop differentiation protocols (that is, directing iPSCs to form populations of other cell types, such as neurons or cardiomyocytes) which are robust and reliable across multiple cell lines when performed in a high throughput manner.",,"

These iPS cells can subsequently give rise to functional      cardiac cells (myocytes) and other cardiovascular cells which might give further clues into      the manifestation of the structural heart disease. This study involves blood sample      collection for pre-screening and skin biopsies to establish skin cell culture.    ,"      Participants are invited to participate in this study because they have been diagnosed with      Marfan's syndrome whereby a gene mutation is suspected to have affected major blood vessel of      their heart or have a Fontan procedure that was carried out to re-direct blood flow in their      heart. This study will recruit 30 subjects from National Heart Centre Singapore over a period      of 1 year.      For clinically diagnosed Marfan disease, a genetic test in a gene called FBN1 will be carried      out to confirm the presence of gene mutation that is suspected to cause the disease. It is      important for them to know that any research finding that indicates the presence of this gene      mutation may only suggest a pre-disposition to Marfan disease, but it does not definitely      ascertain that gene has caused the disease or predict that they will develop the disease.      Further independent clinical genetic testing may be made available, should they so desire      after consulting their doctor or genetic counsellor.

","      Background:      Age-related macular degeneration is a common eye disease in people over 50. The ""dry"" form of      the disease can worsen into geographic atrophy, causing blind spots. Researchers want to      learn if replacing older eye cells with younger ones can help treat this disease.      Objective:      To test the safety of putting cells inside the eye as a possible future treatment for dry      age-related macular degeneration.      Eligibility:      People ages 55 and older who have geographic atrophy with loss of vision. People who have had      ""wet"" macular degeneration in either eye are NOT eligible.      Design:      Participants will be screened with:        -  Medical history        -  Physical exam        -  Blood and urine tests        -  Eye exam        -  Eye photos        -  Fluorescein angiography. An intravenous (IV) line is placed in an arm vein. A dye is           injected. A camera takes pictures of the dye as it flows through the eyes' blood           vessels.        -  Electroretinography. An electrode is taped to participants' forehead. They sit in the           dark. After 30 minutes, numbing eye drops and contact lenses are placed in their eyes.           They watch flashing lights.        -  Tuberculosis test        -  Chest X-ray        -  Electrocardiography. Sticky pads are placed on participants' chest to record the heart's           electrical activity.      Participants will have at least 14 study visits over 5 and a half years. They will repeat      screening tests.      Participants will have retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transplantation surgery in one eye.      For this, cells from participants' blood are turned into RPE cells. These cells are placed in      their eye through a cut in their retina. They will get dilating eye drops, an IV line, and      anesthesia that may make them sleep. A gas bubble will be put in their eye to help it heal.      Participants will be contacted yearly for up to 15 years.    ","      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss among the elderly.      There is no treatment for geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced stage of dry AMD, in which      cells of the neurosensory retina and associated retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) gradually      degenerate and die. Advances in stem cell biology allowing differentiation of pluripotent      cells into RPE in vitro make feasible a cell-based strategy for potential treatment of AMD,      and recent methods for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) generation offer promise of      individualized autologous] therapy. Such an approach involves generation of iPSC from somatic      cells taken from a patient with GA, differentiation of iPSC into RPE grown as a monolayer on      a thin scaffold in vitro, and transplantation of the RPE/scaffold construct into a small      region in the subretinal space of the same patient, with a goal of rescuing the overlying      neurosensory retina from further degeneration.      Objective: To evaluate the safety and feasibility of subretinal transplantation of      iPSC-derived RPE, grown as a monolayer on a biodegradable poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA)      scaffold, as a potential autologous cell-based therapy for GA associated with AMD.      Study Population: Five participants will undergo RPE transplantation in one eye. Eligible      eyes will have GA, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) between 20/100 and 20/500, and a      fellow eye that has same or better BCVA. If the National Eye Institute (NEI) Data and Safety      Monitoring Committee (DSMC) gives clearance to proceed based on review of data from the first      cohort, a second cohort of up to seven additional participants with GA, BCVA between 20/80      and 20/500 in the eye being considered for RPE transplantation, and same or better visual      acuity in the other eye may undergo the procedure to gather additional safety and potential      efficacy data useful for planning future studies. Up to 20 participants may be enrolled to      allow for screening failures or for participants withdrawing from the study prior to RPE      transplantation.      Design: In this phase I/IIa, prospective, single-arm, single-center clinical trial,      participants will undergo subretinal transplantation of autologous iPSC-derived RPE in one      eye and will be followed for five years after surgery.      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the safety of RPE/PLGA transplantation, as      determined by assessment of visual acuity change and summary of adverse events at 12 months      after RPE/PLGA transplantation. Secondary outcome measures include visual acuity change and      adverse event reporting at 24 and 60 months, and changes in the following at 12, 24 and 60      months as compared with baseline, assessed in the transplanted region, and compared where      applicable with other areas in the macula, and/or with corresponding regions in the fellow      eye: retinal sensitivity and fixation parameters assessed by microperimetry; multifocal      electroretinography (ERG) responses; macular structure on cross-sectional and en face imaging      by optical coherence tomography (OCT); macular features on color, single-wavelength      reflectance, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) photography; and fluorescein angiography (FA).      Some participants may undergo imaging of photoreceptor/RPE features using      adaptive-optics-assisted macular imaging under a separate protocol (e.g., 15-EI-0020).    ",,"

Acceptable methods of contraception             include:               -  Hormonal contraception (i.e., birth control pills, injected hormones, dermal                  patch or vaginal ring),               -  Intrauterine device,               -  Barrier methods (diaphragm, condom) with spermicide, or               -  Surgical sterilization (tubal ligation).          -  Participant must be medically able to comply with the study treatment (including             ability to safely receive anesthesia for surgery), study testing and procedures, and             follow-up visits.        Study Eye Inclusion Criteria:          -  The study eye must have one or more regions of geographic atrophy with total area of 1             disc area or more. A region of geographic atrophy is defined as an area of uniform             hypofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging, with greatest linear             dimension at least 500 micrometer , with a border within 500 micrometer of the foveal             center, not compatible with pigmentary changes, drusen, RPE detachment, drusenoid RPE             detachment, hemorrhage, or other lesion. (Note: If macular geographic atrophy is             contiguous with peripapillary atrophy, complicating calculation of total area, only             atrophy temporal to a vertical line placed a half disc diameter temporal to the             temporal border of the disc will be included in the total area of geographic atrophy             calculated for eligibility purposes.)          -  For participants in the first cohort, the study eye must have an ETDRS best-corrected             visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of less than or equal to 53 and greater than or             equal to 14 (i.e., Snellen equivalent between 20/100 and 20/500), and the fellow eye             must have a letter score no more than five letters worse than the study eye using             Electronic Visual Acuity (EVA) testing.

","      Background:      Researchers want to test if certain cells can be re-programmed into stem cells. Stem cells      can keep reproducing for a long time. Cells made by stem cells can be turned into different      types of cells. These include cancer-fighting cells, skin cells, etc. The stem cells      generated in this study will be used to make specific tumor-fighting cells that can recognize      different types of mutations in cancer cells. They may also help identify new tumor mutations      that may not have been identified yet.      Objectives:      To test if a certain type of tumor-fighting cells can be re-programmed into stem cells.      Eligibility:      Participants in another Surgery Branch protocol who are at least 16 years old      Design:      Participants already gave samples of blood and/or tumor tissue in the other protocol. They do      not need to come back to the clinic or give any other samples.      Participants will give consent for their samples to be used in this study.      Researchers will obtain cells from the samples. They will grow those cells in the lab. They      will create stem cells from them.      Researchers will do genetic tests on the samples.      Most tests will not show important health results. But if they do, the participant will be      invited to talk to a genetic counselor and get more detailed testing to confirm the results.      Some of the samples and results will be stored indefinitely. They may be used in future      research. No personal information will be stored with them.      ...    ","      Background:      T-cells are potentially curative for patients with metastatic cancer, but many patients with      cancer have T-cells that are terminally differentiated , a condition associated with      treatment failure. We have observed that less differentiated T-cells have a greater capacity      to proliferate, persist, and destroy large cancer deposits. Advances in regenerative medicine      might allow the generation of rejuvenated T-cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC).      Objectives:      To reprogram patient specimens into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and differentiate      them into different types of somatic cells with the goal to produce cancer antigen-specific      T-cells.      To make stored specimens and/or data available to approved research laboratories and      investigators.

",,"      Background:      - Pluripotent stem cells are cells that can be converted to any type of cell (muscle, nerve,      liver, etc.). Researchers are collecting blood samples to develop way to make a special cell      product called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs may be used to repair or replace      organs and tissues, produce blood and immune cells for transfusion, or correct inherited      immune and blood diseases. iPSCs can be made from many kinds samples, such as skin, blood, or      hair. This is different from embryonic stem cells, which can only be derived from embryos.      Objectives:      - To develop new methods to make iPSCs; to identify better ways to collect, produce, and grow      them; and to make an iPSC bank.      Eligibility:      - Healthy adults and adults already in a treatment protocol who have a medical condition that      could be treated with iPSCs.      Design:        -  All participants will be screened with questionnaire, physical exam, and blood and HIV           tests.        -  All participants:        -  Will donate 4 tablespoons of blood. It will be taken by needle from a vein in their arm.        -  Participants already in another protocol:        -  Will have their blood collected, separated in a lab, and iPSCs grown in large numbers.           Some may have their sample given back to them as a treatment.        -  Samples will be kept in the study up to 5 years or until a participant withdraws from           the study or becomes ineligible to participate, or the study is closed. If participants           have not withdrawn their consent, they may be contacted in the future to donate again.    ","      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be produced from small quantities of blood.      Clinical protocols to treat several diseases using iPSCs or cells derived from iPSCs are      being developed by intramural investigators, i.e., investigators in National Institute of      Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and National Eye Institute (NEI). This clinical      protocol will allow personnel in the Cell Processing Service (CPS) of the Department of      Transfusion Medicine (DTM) to collect blood from healthy donors or patients with diseases      targeted in IRB-approved treatment protocols to manufacture iPSCs or iPSC derived products to      support these intramural investigators. CPS DTM will submit a Drug Master File (DMF) to the      US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the manufacture and testing of these products. When      iPSCs are used clinically in some cases the donors will be the recipients of the iPSCs, or      the ex vivo expanded and differentiated iPSCs (autologous therapy). In other cases, healthy      subjects will serve as donors of the blood used as starting material for manufacturing iPSCs      (allogeneic therapy) where no matching of HLA or other antigens is required between the      healthy blood donor and the iPSC recipient. While methods to produce and expand iPSCs have      been described, they must be modified periodically to meet changing Good Manufacturing      Practices (GMP) requirements for manufacturing clinical cell and gene therapies, therefore      peripheral blood for iPSCs from normal donors is needed for research and development.

","      This research is being done to better understand the causes of the disease      Ataxia-Telangiectasia and, in the longer-term, develop new therapies for the disease using      stem cells.      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) are a type of cells that can be made in the laboratory      from cells in your body, such as blood cells or skin cells (fibroblasts). These stem cells      can then be used for research purposes. For example, stem cells can be used to investigate      how the mutation in ATM causes the actual symptoms of Ataxia-Telangiectasia. In addition, the      stem cells can be used to screen for drugs that could be helpful to treat the disease or to      develop new laboratory techniques to correct the mutation that causes Ataxia-Telangiectasia.      where the mutation that causes the disease is corrected by the investigators. The stem cells      generated in this study will not be used directly for patient therapy and therefore this      research does not have a direct benefit to you. However, it will help advance our      understanding of the disease and develop future therapies.      Patients who enroll in this study will get all of the standard therapy they would get for      their tumor whether or not they participate in this study. There is no extra or different      therapy given. The study involves a one-time procedure (either blood collection or skin      biopsy).    ","      Ataxia-Telangiectasia (A-T) is a devastating genetic syndrome of neurodegeneration,      immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition caused by mutations in the locus encoding ATM      (Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated). The current standard of care for A-T consists of aggressive      supportive measures, and the prognosis remains poor. There is therefore a pressing need to      develop novel experimental approaches and treatments for this disease. In this application,      we propose to address this need by developing for the first time human stem cell-based      technologies to: 1) generate novel experimental models for A-T that faithfully recapitulate      the features of the disease across its complex spectrum of clinical manifestations (Aim 1);      and 2) start to test the feasibility of regenerative therapies for A-T, via generation of      autologous stem cells that have been rendered disease-free by correction of the mutation (Aim      2). Mutations causing A-T are private, resulting in variable reduction in ATM activity and,      correspondingly, a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Although the most severe form of      the disease (""classical"" A-T, with no detectable ATM) has been modeled in the mouse (ATM      ""knock out""), this approach fails to recapitulate the neurological symptoms of the disease      and its characteristic tumor spectrum. Moreover, we are currently lacking experimental models      for those patients whose mutations result in reduced ATM activity (""variant"" A-T). To address      these issues, experiments in Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the genotype-phenotype      correlation in A-T is maintained in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).      To test this hypothesis, we will reprogram fibroblasts from A-T patients with variable      reduction of ATM levels and determine whether: 1) ATM expression and activity in the iPSCs      correlate directly with those observed in the patient fibroblasts they are derived from; 2)      the iPSCs recapitulate the phenotypes observed in the fibroblasts, including impaired cell      cycle checkpoint activation, defective DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, radiosensitivity      and genomic instability; and 3) these phenotypes in the iPSCs directly correlate with their      level of ATM expression/activity. If we find that the genotype-phenotype correlation is      maintained in A-T iPSCs, this work would validate a more general use of autologous iPSCs for      preclinical studies of A-T, including the evaluation of disease biomarkers, drug testing or      genetic screening. The clinical manifestations of A-T result from progressive cell loss and      tissue degeneration, making A-T a candidate disease for regenerative therapies. Experiments      in Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that correction of the ATM mutation in A-T somatic cells      will rescue their severe reprogramming defect and allow the generation of disease-free iPSCs.      To test this hypothesis, we propose a series of proof-of-principle experiments using a      well-characterized compound heterozygous A-T fibroblast cell line. First, we will ""repair""      either one or the two ATM mutations in this line by recombination with an exogenous donor      plasmid carrying the intact sequence, to generate either ""carriers"" (one normal allele and      one mutated allele) or ""intact"" cells (two normal alleles). To increase the efficiency of      recombination, we will introduce a DSB in close proximity to the mutation using Transcription      Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENS) that bind specifically to the mutated region. In      Preliminary Experiments, we find that we can successfully induce DSBs and site-specific      recombination at a human ""safe harbor"" locus as well as at the ATM locus itself. After      verifying that recombination restores ATM expression and function, we will reprogram the      corrected cells into iPSCs and characterize their level of ATM expression, activity and      function with passage. Because the ""null"", ""carrier"" and ""intact"" lines are isogenic, the      effect of ATM gene dose on reprogramming and iPSC function can be evaluated in these      experiments. In this regard, approximately 1% of the US general population is an A-T      ""carrier"", extending the significance of this work well beyond A-T patients. Overall,      completion of this Exploratory Project will provide the rationale, expertise and reagents for      longer-term studies aimed at modeling and treating A-T with autologous iPSCs and/or their      derived products and optimizing the use of regenerative therapies for the general population.

",,"      Background:      - Researchers are interested in studying the roles that genes play in drug and alcohol      addiction. Genes seem to account for about half of the differences between people who become      addicted to drugs and people who do not. This study will collect blood and skin cell samples.      These cells will be used to develop stem cells that are useful for studying how genes are      related to drug use and dependence.      Objectives:      - To study genetic and cellular differences between people who are addicted to drugs and      those who are not.      Eligibility:        -  Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who do not use drugs.        -  Individuals between 21 and 65 years of age who are in treatment with buprenorphine or           methadone.      Design:        -  Participants will be screened with a brief physical exam and medical history.        -  Participants will also answer questions about physical and mental health, quality of           life, and history of drug and alcohol use. A urine sample and cheek swab sample will be           collected.        -  Participants whose genetic samples match the study requirements will be asked to come           back to provide a skin biopsy sample and a second urine sample.    ","      Background - The molecular- and cellular-based mechanisms that contribute to the initiation      and development of addiction remain to be elucidated. Estimates have suggested that 40-60      percent of the vulnerability to addiction may be attributable to genetic aberrations.      Multiple chromosomal regions have been linked to addiction including those containing the      dopamine transporter (DAT) and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) genes. Current efforts      to understand how polymorphisms in these monoamine transporters contribute to the molecular      mechanisms of addiction are severely hindered by the inability to directly interrogate neural      cell types from the patients. There is great potential for patient-specific iPS cell      technology to profoundly impact our understanding of human development and disease by      providing genetically distinct, functional sources of human cells.      Objective - The objective of the research is to develop a cell-based system whereby neural      cells from afflicted individuals can be functionally assayed to interrogate the molecular      mechanisms underlying addiction.      Study population Controls (non-drug users) and opioid dependent adults receiving opioid      agonist therapy aged 21- 65 will be enrolled.      Design Participants demographic characteristics, psychosocial evaluation, and psychiatric,      medical, and drug use histories will be characterized. DNA will be collected via cheek swabs      of up to 30 potential participants for determination of dopamine transporter (DAT) and      vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) gene polymorphisms. Participants (N=16) with suitable      polymorphisms will be asked to under go skin biopsies; 2 individuals for each of two      genotypes for each gene (DAT or VMAT), i.e., 8 samples from addicts and 8 samples for control      subjects. Collaborators at Case Western Reserve University will use the skin cells to derive      and characterize patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry monoamine      transporter polymorphisms for the hDAT1 and hVMAT2 genes. They will differentiate      patient-specific iPS cells line into dopaminergic neurons and carry out a detailed and      functional characterization of these cells to identify their molecular characteristics.      Outcome measures - Biological specimens from the addiction patients and controls will be used      to derive and characterize patient-specific, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that carry      monoamine transporter polymorphisms. Patient-specific iPS cells lines will be differentiated      into dopaminergic neurons. In follow up studies, we will characterize, compare, and      functionally assay these patient-specific, iPS cell-derived dopaminergic neurons from control      and addiction patients that carry polymorphisms for hDAT1 and hVMAT2 gene to investigate any      possible association with dopamine neurotransmission variations and vulnerability to      addiction.

","      Heart failure (HF) is the common end-stage of different medical conditions. It is the only      growing cardiovascular disease and its prognosis remains worse than that of many      malignancies. The lack of evidence-based treatment for patients with diastolic HF (HFpEF)      exemplifies that the current ""one for all"" therapy has to be advanced by an individualized      approach. Inherited cardiomyopathies can serve as paradigmatic examples of different HF      pathogenesis. Both gain- and loss-of-function mutations of the same gene cause disease,      calling for disease-specific agonism or antagonism of this gene´s function. However,      mutations alone do not predict the severity of cardiomyopathies nor therapy, because their      impact on cardiac myocyte function is modified by numerous factors, including the genetic      context. Today, patient-specific cardiac myocytes can be evaluated by the induced pluripotent      stem cell (hiPSC) technology. Yet, unfolding the true potential of this technology requires      robust, quantitative, high content assays. The researchers' recently developed method to      generate 3D-engineered heart tissue (EHT) from hiPSC provides an automated, high content      analysis of heart muscle function and the response to stressors in the dish. The aim of this      project is to make the technology a clinically applicable test. Major steps are (i) in depths      clinical phenotyping and genotyping of patients with cardiomyopathies or HFpEF, (ii)      follow-up of the clinical course, (iii) generation of hiPSC lines (40 patients, 40 healthy      controls), and (iv) quantitative assessment of hiPSC-EHT function under basal conditions and      in response to pro-arrhythmic or cardio-active drugs and chronic afterload enhancement. The      product of this study is an SOP-based assay with standard values for hiPSC-EHT      function/stress responses from healthy volunteers and patients with different heart diseases.      The project could change clinical practice and be a step towards individualized risk      prediction and therapy of HF.    ","      At present, heart function in patients can only be analysed by imaging methods or hemodynamic      measurements. This has dramatically changed by the discovery that hiPSC can be generated from      somatic cells (e.g. fibroblasts) by transduction of pluripotency genes. The investigators and      others have shown that pluripotent stem cells can be efficiently differentiated into beating      cardiac myocytes. This allows for the first time to study the function of cardiac myocytes      from an individual patient. However, at present, only alterations were reproduced in hiPSC      cells that were known previously and important limitations have to be resolved:        -  Immaturity of hiPSC-derived cardiac myocytes        -  Variability of hiPSC-generation, cardiac myocyte differentiation and experimental           analyses        -  No readout of contractile force, the parameter mostly affected in heart failure        -  No modeling of hemodynamic stress in vitro        -  No statistically valid correlation of hiPSC-cardiac myocyte function with           clinical/genetic data        -  Uncertainty as to standard values and adequate controls        -  Unclear predictive value      The research challenge for the coming years is to resolve these shortcomings. IndivuHeart      formulates a number of hypotheses and goals that are based on the researchers' longstanding      expertise in tissue engineering and recent, still unpublished data on the pathophysiology of      HCM and its modeling in EHT. The study will        -  reveal standard values for hiPSC-EHT function in a statistically valid manner, both           under basal and stress conditions,        -  define a ""cardiomyopathy phenotype"" in vitro,        -  allow new mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of human HCM and DCM,        -  uncover HCM-like abnormalities in HFpEF,        -  allow individualized drug testing (acute and chronic).

up to 60 month
All 40 patients will be subjected to (i) high-end echocardiography including tissue Doppler and speckle tracking technology, (ii) MRI, (iii) spiroergometry and (iv) 24 h-holter ECG monitoring. Key parameters are guideline-recommended indices of systolic (e.g. fractional shortening, ejection fraction) and diastolic heart function (e.g. left atrial size, E/A, E'/A' and E/E´ratios), outflow tract gradient and cardiac remodeling (gadolinium late enhancement). The latter will be only done in HCM/DCM for ethical reasons. Technical analyses will be made at study entry and after 4 years, clinical examinations once a year (Cardiomyopathy Outpatient Clinic). Patients and their treating physicians will be prompted to report any clinical event during the course of the study.
, 
genotyping
up to 60 month
The genetic part of this project does not focus on the detection of new HCM/DCM disease genes, but on comprehensively determining the molecular basis of cardiomyopathy in the included patients. DNA samples will first be subjected to sequencing of a panel of about 120 cardiomyopathy-related candidate genes, which detects approximately 75% of all disease-causing mutations. The rest will be analysed by whole genome sequencing.
The resulting sequence data will be processed using CASAVA, followed by subsequent analyses using the GATK software package provided through the Broad Institute (Boston, USA) and the commercial software CLC-BIO.

",,"      Female urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are common diseases especially in aged      women that frequently cause urogenital infection, voiding difficulty, urinary retention,      pelvic pain, constipation, and coital difficulty, as well as impact the quality of life of      women. Risk factors of the above diseases include pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and menopausal      status. Despite playing a crucial role in the pathophysiology of the above diseases, the      urogenital skeletal muscular dysfunction cannot be fully corrected via the current treatment      modalities.      The human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) represent a prime candidate cell type for      current research and future cell therapy because of their significant self-renewal,      differentiation potential and the relative lack of ethical conflict. With the advent of      efficient technology of reprogramming peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) into hiPSCs,      researchers can generate personalized lines of cells from which it will be possible to obtain      differentiated cells in a less invasive way, introducing opportunities in treating diseases      that are now considered incurable.      Until very recently, little success has been achieved in terms of skeletal muscle      differentiation from hiPSCs. The purpose of this study is to explore the applicability of the      differentiation into skeletal muscle progenitor cells from hiPSC cell lines and the      associated biomolecular messages. It is anticipated that the derived skeletal muscle      progenitor cells can be reprogrammed from PBMCs of female patients with urinary incontinence      and/or pelvic organ prolapse and used in preclinical testing for relieving female urogenital      problems.

","      Background: Autosomal recessive bestrophinopathy (ARB) is one of 5 blinding eye diseases      caused by mutations in the gene BEST1. These diseases, collectively termed      ""bestrophinopathies"" include ARB, Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (BVMD), adult-onset      vitelliform dystrophy (AVMD), autosomal dominant vitreoretinalchoroidopathy (ADVIRC) and      retinitis pigmentosa (RP) .      Objective: To collect DNA/RNA and skin samples from individuals with ARB or other diseases      due to mutations in the gene BEST1. These models will be used to identify and test      therapeutic approaches to treating these diseases.      Design: Study involves a one time donation of a skin punch biopsy and whole blood. Once the      skin biopsy is obtained, skin fibroblasts will be isolated, which will be reprogrammed into      iPSCs. RPE cells will be derived from the iPSCs    ","      The PI on this proposal has been studying BEST1 and the protein encoded (Best1) since its      discovery in 1998. Best1 is an integral membrane protein that in the eye is expressed only by      retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells where it is localized to the basolateral plasma      membrane.      Methods: Once a subject has been identified as a potential candidate, a study coordinator      will meet with the subject, to discuss the study prior to sample collection. The study      coordinator will review the consent form with the subject and spend as much time as necessary      answering any questions. Once the subject has signed the consent form, study procedures will      begin.      Following the consent process, a skin sample will be obtained from subjects using a (4mm)      dermal punch biopsy method. This will be accomplished in a single visit to the Regenerative      Medicine Consult Service or other approved clinical examination room. A suture may need to be      placed following this skin biopsy. A health care provider (either at Mayo Clinic or a local      health care provider's office) can remove the stitches, or the subject can remove them with a      provided disposable suture removal kit.      Subjects will also be asked to undergo venipuncture; all subjects will be asked to have the      venipuncture and have the option to refuse. 10ml of blood will be collected for RNA and DNA      extraction.      Once the skin biopsy is obtained,skin fibroblasts will be isolated, which will be      reprogrammed into iPSCs. RPE cells will be derived from the iPSCs.      Remuneration: If subjects make a special trip only for the research procedures, they may be      reimbursed for travel expenses including: airfare, mileage, parking, and hotel. In order to      receive reimbursement, they must provide a copy of the original receipts for those expenses.      Reimbursement will not exceed $1000.00.    ",,"

",      Establishment of human cellular disease models for Wilson disease for an individualized      therapy develop-ment having the capacity to address both hepatic and neurologic forms of the      disease    ,"      Wilson disease (WD) is caused by a defective gene for a copper-transporting protein that      regulates cellular copper homeostasis in all major organs. Copper is an essential metal ion      that is required for physiological cell functions (e.g. numerous enzymes require copper as a      co-factor). It often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.      The condition affects females and males likewise. Wilson disease occurs in approximately 1      out of every 30,000 births and belongs to the class of rare diseases. Because this is an      inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Wilson disease.      Symptoms most often appear during adolescence or early adulthood. Symptoms may include:      increased thickness of the interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall      supraventricular tachycardias tremors in hands, legs, head repetitive muscle contractions      (dystonia) renal stones renal failure psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression) liver disease      Therapeutic approaches include the drug Penicillamine, which binds to accumulated copper and      eliminate it through urine. However, its use is controversy, since it is associated with an      extended range of adverse effects and patients with neurologic manifestations deteriorated      throughout the use of Penicillamine. Another strategy is the use of zinc salts that function      via a detoxification effect of the stored copper ions. Recent studies suggested that zinc      salts are effective in presymptomatic Wilson disease, but are problematic in hepatic Wilson      disease and not suitable as a monotherapy.      In Wilson disease, the mutations of the hepatic copper transport ATP7B lead to a defective      accumulation of copper in the cells. In addition to this primary pathological process,      certain allelic variants (mutations in the protein-coding DNA region) are associated with the      formation of a protein folding defect, often associated with considerable endoplasmic      reticulum (ER) stress, which exposes the cell to a stress that leads to inflammatory      reactions and in the worst case can lead to apoptotic cell death with the consequence of      functional organ confinement, devastating disorders of whole organ systems and formation of      tumors. Thus, ER stress can be involved in a substantial part of the clinical picture of the      disease and support the progressive character of the disease. ER stress-associated protein      mutants are generally able to re-spond to certain low-molecular-weight substances affecting      cellular proteostasis. i.e. that the malignant influence of the misfolded protein on cellular      physiology is mitigated or corrected.      A newly developed molecular therapeutic approach involves Pharmacological Chaperone therapy      suitable to overcome protein misfolding and ER stress. The concept is that active-site      binding low molecular competitive inhibitors (Pharmacological Chaperones) are able to      stabilize the misfolded protein, bypass early degradation pathways (such as the      ubiquitin-proteasome-system) and enhance/re-establish protein function at the site of action      within the cell. These drugs are typically orally available, can reach even difficult to      target organs (e.g. central nervous system) and are able to correct the pathophysiology. In      addition to this class of inhibitory Pharmacological Chaperones, non-inhibitory PCs are being      developed, because the multi-functional ATP7B protein provides distinct sites for a putative      ligand binding.      A second class of low-molecular-weight substances target other components of the proteostasis      network, e.g. the heat shock proteins or the proteasome as mediators to handle abnormally      accumulated proteins within the ER.      Among the amenable protein folding diseases, the investigators investigated a few lysosomal      storage dis-eases like Fabry, Gaucher and Pompe disease within recent years. A      proof-of-concept study revealed Wilson disease as another pathology that can be addressed via      this molecular therapeutic approach.      Therefore it is the goal of the study to prepare a cell culture from patients affected with      Wil-son´s disease in order to identify novel pathways and proteins involved in disease      progression that allow for an earlier diagnosis (i.e. before symptom onset) and that are      suitable targets for an individualized therapeutic approach able to address not only the      hepatic form, but also the neurologic form of the disease, which is less responsive to the      current therapeutic approaches.

",      Establishment of human cellular disease models for Morquio disease for an individualized      therapy development having the capacity to address both hepatic and neurologic forms of the      disease    ,"      The mucopolysaccharidoses are a group of inherited lysosomal storage disorders. Lysosomes      function as the primary digestive units within cells. Enzymes within lysosomes break down or      digest particular nutrients, such as certain carbohydrates and fats. In individuals with MPS      disorders, deficiency or malfunction of specific lysosomal enzymes lead to an abnormal      accumulation of certain complex carbohydrates (mucopolysaccharides or glycosaminoglycans) in      the arteries, skeleton, eyes, joints, ears, skin and/or teeth. These accumulations may also      be found in the respiratory system, liver, spleen, central nervous system, blood, and bone      marrow. This accumulation eventually causes progressive damage to cells, tissues, and various      organ systems of the body. There are several different types and subtypes of      mucopolysaccharidosis. These disorders, with one exception, are inherited as autosomal      recessive traits and all vary in their clinical phenotype. Within our clinical trial we focus      on MPS type IV.      Morquio syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type IV; MPS IV) is a mucopolysaccharide storage      disease that exists in two forms (Morquio syndromes A and B) and occurs because of a      deficiency of the enzymes N-acetyl-galactosamine-6-sulfatase and beta-galactosidase,      respectively. A deficiency of either enzyme leads to the accumulation of mucopolysaccharides      in the body, abnormal skeletal development, and additional symptoms. In most cases,      individuals with Morquio syndrome have normal intelligence. The clinical features of MPS IV-B      are less severe than those associated with MPS IV-A. Symptoms may include growth retardation,      a prominent lower face, an abnormally short neck, knees that are abnormally close together      (knock knees or genu valgum), flat feet, abnormal sideways and front-to-back or side-to-side      curvature of the spine (kyphoscoliosis), abnormal development of the growing ends of the long      bones (epiphyses) resulting in dwarfism, and/or a prominent breast bone (pectus carinatum) as      well as bell shaped chest. Though the CNS and peripheral nerves are primarily not affected      the bone defects may result in neurological symptoms such as spinal cord compression. Hearing      loss, weakness of the legs, and/or additional abnormalities may also occur.      The goal of the study is to prepare a cell culture from patients affected with Morquio      disease in order to identify novel pathways and proteins involved in disease progression that      allow for an earlier diagnosis (i.e. before symptom onset) and that are suitable targets for      an individualized therapeutic approach able to address not only the hepatic form, but also      the neurologic form of the disease, which is less responsive to the current therapeutic      approaches.

Abnormalities in the development of the affected      cells as well as altered survival or function of the cells may be studied. Thus iPS cells may      serve as an invaluable model for the study of the pathogenesis of human diseases and may also      serve for the development of new drugs, and high throughput screening of molecules for toxic      or therapeutic effects.      In addition to the great potential of iPS cells for disease modelling and transplantation      therapy, the cells may have broad applications in basic research in various areas such as      reprogramming, basic development and others.      At present, it is still unclear whether the properties of iPS cells are identical to those of      hESCs. Initial data suggest that human iPS cells are indeed similar to hESCs in their      phenotype, epigenetic status of pluripotent self-specific genes, telomerase activity, gene      expression profile and in their capability to differentiate into progeny of the three germ      layers both in vitro and in vivo in teratomas (2, 3, 5). In the mouse system, directed      differentiation of iPS cells into bone marrow repopulating hematopoietic stem cells and      functional dopaminergic neurons was demonstrated (6, 7). However, incomplete silencing of the      constitutive expression of the transcription factors that were used to induce reprogramming      can probably interfere with differentiation (1). Further studies are required to confirm that      the developmental potential and biological properties of iPS cells are identical to hESC.      Currently, retroviral vectors are most commonly used to introduce and express the transgenes      which reprogram the somatic nucleus (1-5). The use of retroviral vectors, which integrate      into the host cell genome, may cause hazardous insertion mutagenesis. Moreover, the use of      potentially oncogenic transcription factors, such as c-Myc, significantly limits the clinical      use of human iPS cells for future cell therapy. However, successful derivation of iPS cells      was demonstrated without the forced expression of c-Myc. The decreased efficiency of      reprogramming, in the absence of overexpressed c-Myc, may be improved by molecules which act      via epigenetic mechanisms. Moreover, successful derivation of iPS cells was recently reported      with the use of non-integrating adeno viral vectors or repeated transfections. Thus it      appears that with further developments, it may be possible in the future to safely induce      pluripotent cells from somatic cells for therapeutic applications.    ",,"

","      The purpose of this project is to see if heritable alterations in the function, biology and      vascular repair capacity of vascular cells make a major contribution to the burden of      coronary artery disease (CAD), fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and other vascular diseases.      In more detail, FMD is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that primarily affects women      aged 20 to 60. It commonly affects the renal and carotid arteries but may involve almost      every artery in the body. At the cellular level, FMD is characterized by increased fibroblast      proliferation and collagen deposition. This study aims to define some of these cellular      problems by directly studying fibroblast cells from FMD patients and healthy control      subjects. Similarly, CAD is among the leading causes of death worldwide. However, a large      part of the risk for CAD is unexplained. It is thought that a major but undefined risk factor      may be gene (genomic) variations causing a change in vascular cell function. Here, we will      study important vascular cell types in patients with severe and early onset CAD in an attempt      to define these problems. Therefore, in summary, this study will look to define the various      cellular-level problems that occur in patients with both in CAD and FMD. These data will be      linked to DNA-level analyses to ultimately attempt to define the cause of these conditions.    ","      The purpose of this project is to see if heritable alterations in the function, biology and      vascular repair capacity of vascular cells make a major contribution to the burden of      coronary artery disease (CAD), fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), and other vascular diseases.      Patients will be referred for this study by their physician if he/she feels that the patient      qualifies for entry into the study based upon the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria and is      expected by their physician to be a suitable candidate. This will include: 1) patients with      FMD and non-affected control subjects, 2) patients with early onset CAD in the absence of      significant CAD risk factors, or matching healthy controls those with ≥2 cardiovascular risk      factors and no CAD (those with angiographically 'normal' coronary arteries). Also, as an      extension of this study, patients with rare, undiagnosed or unusual forms of CAD (e.g.      unexplained dissection, fulminant calcification, aneurysms etc.) and appropriate controls,      will be recruited, particularly if there is a strong family pedigree.      This study will include collection of whole blood for subsequent DNA isolation and      sequencing, a plasma sample, and a skin biopsy. Blood will be handled in a standard fashion      to obtain DNA from leukocytes and plasma. These will be stored pending later batched      analysis. Once the skin biopsy tissue is collected, the tissue will be sent to the lab for      further processing. The initial step is that we will derive fibroblasts from the skin      biopsies. In brief, the biopsies are washed, cut into small fragments are distributed on a      culture dish with growth medium and incubated at 37°C. Over the next 4 - 6 weeks, fibroblasts      progressively grow and can be collected. We may then induce these fibroblasts to undergo      changes so that they become stem cells (called ""induced pluripotent stem cells"" or iPSCs).      Once we have made iPSCs, we can then make endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), or in fact, many      other cell types. The cells can be frozen until analysis, or until experiments are done in      the future. All of the derived cells (fibroblasts, iPSCs and iPSC-ECs) generated under this      protocol will be kept indefinitely, and may be used for future studies into the causes and      other aspects of FMD or CAD.      This study is not concerned with any clinical events after patient enrollment. Only clinical      events that have occurred prior to enrollment (e.g. prior myocardial infarction, stroke,      dissection) will be recorded. Once we have obtained these cells, detailed cellular and      molecular analyses will be performed to study the particular cellular defects that are      associated with these differing conditions. This data will be combined with the DNA- and      plasma-derived data in an attempt to define the underlying basis for these disorders.      As this is not a treatment, no alternative treatment options apply. The subject can decide      not to participate in the trial. No benefit can be promised to any subject in this study. The      information gained may benefit others with the same condition.    ",,"

","      According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental retardation (MR) is defined by an      intelligence quotient (IQ) < 70 and touches between 1 to 3 % of the general population.      Profound mental retardation (QI <25), severe (IQ: 25-40) and moderate (QI : 40-50) have a      prevalence of 0,3-0,5% while the prevalence of mild MR, defined by an IQ between 50 and 70 is      evaluated to about 1,5 %.      The origin of MR can be infectious, toxic, traumatic, genetic or environmental. genetic      causes of MR gather the number and structure anomalies of the chromosomes, the genomic      microreorganization, monogenic diseases and more rarely other non Mendelian-inherited      anomalies like print or epigenetic anomalies, mutations of the mitochondrial genome etc...      Genetic causes represents 50% of moderate to severe, whereas environmental factors      (malnutrition, cultural deprivation,...) plays an important role in mild MR.      The main goal of this study is to get an innovative tool (neuronal distinction of iPSC) that      wil allow to study the functionnal impact of mutations uppon genes probably involved in MR      like MYT1L. The main criteria associated to characterisation of the tool by the trial is the      study of the pluripotency of iPSC obtained and to highlight the mutation of the gene MYT1L in      the iPSC.      Neurons from the iPSC of the patient and his father du patient wille also be morphologically      characterised, but also thanks to the expression of specifically neurals genes.      Characteristics of iPSC and neurons from d'iPSC with MYT1L mutation will be compared among      the patient and his father, in relation with the same cells coming from the two witnesses.    ",,,"

",      Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare and severe congenital developmental disorder      characterized by congenital anomalies and intellectual disability with a long term memory      deficit. The main challenge is to improve the intellectual and memory efficiency of these      patients. CREBBP and EP300 are the two genes known to cause RSTS. Both paralogs play a major      role in chromatin remodeling and encode for transcriptional co-activators interacting with      many proteins.      The aim of this pilot study is to characterize the histone acetylation profiles in order to      identify specific acetylation markers during normal and pathological neuronal differentiation      of cortical and pyramidal neurons in RSTS.    ,"      CREBBP and EP300 are the two paralog genes associated with RSTS determinism and code for CBP      and p300, respectively. These proteins are transcriptional coactivators that possess a      catalytic lysine acetyl transferase (KAT) domain involved in the acetylation of lysine      residues of histones but also other proteins. CBP and p300 promote transcription by creating      a chromatin environment that is favorable for gene expression and by linking different      transcription factors to each other. They thus orchestrate the regulation of the      transcription machinery, from the basal promoter to the enhancers of the target genes.      RSTS is considered a genetic model of neurodevelopmental anomaly with an epigenetic      component.      Histone acetylation is one of the major post-translational modifications (PTMs) of these      proteins that provide for the formation and control of chromatin structure. When      differentiating embryonic cells, this modification plays a key role in transcriptional      activation.      The mouse models of RSTS have made the link between the modulation of histone acetylation and      the formation of memory by showing their key role in neuronal plasticity. However no data      exists on the acetylation of histones in the neurons of RSTS patients. Furthermore, in      humans, the molecular pathways impacted by these alterations during neurodevelopment are not      specified, especially in the pyramidal neurons which are the precursors of hippocampal      neurons involved in the encoding and storage of memory.      In RSTS a loss of CBP function results in a deficit in KAT activity, which is responsible for      altering histone acetylation, leading to inappropriate changes in chromatin structure. The      consequence of a mutation is a result of a deregulation of the activity of genes involved in      development. No neuronal level studies are currently available on the functional link between      histone acetylation and deregulated genes in the RSTS.      In this project, investigators will identify target genes whose epigenetic regulation is      mediated by histone acetylation. More specifically, the study will focus on chromatin      dynamics during normal and pathological neuronal differentiation of cortical and pyramidal      neurons. Investigators will determine among the CBP-dependent histone markers, those that are      modified in RSTS patients cells and the loci they control. In parallel, investigators will      define genes whose neuronal expression is altered in RSTS patients.      The integration of all these data will allow us to specify which genes are deregulated during      neuronal differentiation as a consequence of CBP lysine acetyltransferase function loss.    ",,"

","      Topic of this work is the involvement of replicative helicases in human premature ageing      syndrome. Replicative helicases are ubiquitous and essential during numerous reactions of the      DNA metabolism.      The family of replicative helicases (RecQL) is involved in the replication/repair of the DNA      and in the telomere maintenance. There are 5 enzymes in human and 3 of them are involved in      clinically recognizable syndromes: WRN for the Werner syndrome, BLM for the Bloom syndrome      and RECQL4 for the Rothmund Thomson syndrome. All are responsive of a high cancer risk due to      genomic instability. Molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in these diseases of ageing      are unknown. Moreover, for all of them, there is not therapeutic or preventive solution.    ","      For understanding the involved mechanisms we would like to model the 3 diseases with hiPS      (human induced Pluripotent Stem cells) from somatic cells of patients. The patient      recruitment was organized by the Montpellier and Nîmes public hospitals.      The project is to generate a hiPS cell line for the 3 syndromes from fibroblasts and/or blood      samples. Then, we could induce differentiation of hiPS to a target cell line of the diseases.      Finally we could study the disease development following the genomic instability (karyotype,      array-CGH) and the cellular ageing (senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, telomere      length).      For each mutated enzyme, we will perform a transcriptional profiling (splice, mRNA      quantification) and protein studies (western blot). All results will be compared to wild type      cells.

","      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder resulting from mutations found in      the gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This      clinical study will enroll 22 participants without the F508del mutation, carrying partial      function mutations not approved for Trikafta, and who are not expected to be approved for      CFTR modulator treatment in the immediate future. Each participant will be given Trikafta for      approximately four weeks. The study researchers will monitor clinical endpoints that include      forced expiratory volume (FEV1), sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.      Additionally, the researchers will obtain skin biopsy material from each subject so that      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be modified into airway cell monolayers and tested      for response to Trikafta. In this way, the study will evaluate an emerging and readily      accessible in vitro endpoint as a predictor of clinical response. This study will serve as a      pilot/test case for other clinical protocols relevant to patients with rare CFTR variants who      do not currently receive modulator therapies. It is hypothesized that a robust correlation      will be established between in vitro Trikafta responsiveness of iPS cells and in vivo benefit      (FEV1) to patients, and will provide a new tool for utilizing iPS to identify patient      populations most suitable for cystic fibrosis modulator therapy.    ","      Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life threatening genetic disorder resulting from mutations found in      the gene known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Defects in      this gene prevent correct chloride transport in and out of cells. It has become increasingly      important to develop new in vitro model systems capable of predicting in vivo clinical      effectiveness of modulator therapy among patients with CF. This objective represents a      significant and unmet need for advancing personalized therapeutics in the disease. The      current trial is intended to show for the first time that primary iPS cells differentiated to      an airway epithelial phenotype can be used to predict in vivo clinical response for rare CF      patient populations - with the long-term goal of facilitating drug access for individuals      with unusual (or even private) CF variants.      Trikafta is currently approved for patients with CF carrying at least one copy of the common      F508del variant. This study is a clinical study of 22 subjects without the F508del mutation,      carrying partial function mutations not approved for Trikafta, and who are not expected to be      approved for CFTR modulator treatment in the immediate future.      Each participant will have clinical and/or preclinical evidence that Trikafta should offer      benefit, and each will be given Trikafta for approximately four weeks. The researchers will      monitor clinical endpoints that include FEV1, sweat chloride, and nasal potential difference.      The study will differentiate iPS cells from each subject to generate airway epithelial      monolayers that can be tested for response to Trikafta. In this way, this study will evaluate      an emerging and readily accessible in vitro surrogate endpoint as a predictor of clinical      response. This trial will also serve as a pilot/test case for other clinical protocols      relevant to patients with rare CFTR variants and evidence of residual function who do not      have an approved modulator therapy-due to rarity of their mutation. It is hypothesized that a      robust correlation will be established between in vitro Trikafta responsiveness of iPS cells      and in vivo benefit (FEV1) in patients, and provide a powerful tool for utilizing iPS cells      to identify rare CF patient populations most suitable for cystic fibrosis modulator therapy.

Change in sweat chloride
Baseline, Days 14, 28, 56
Persons with CF have higher levels of chloride in their sweat. Sweat chloride concentrations of less than or equal to 29 mmol/L are considered normal, concentrations of 30-59 mmol/L are considered intermediate and indicate that the individual may have CF. Concentrations of 60 mmol/L and more mean that a diagnosis of CF is likely.
, 
Change in nasal potential difference (NPD) measurements
Baseline, Days 7, 14, 28, 56
Nasal potential difference assesses the function of CFTR protein by measuring the electrical response of nasal mucosa to the perfusion of different ionic solutions. The nasal potential difference test uses a small needle placed under the skin of the arm a few inches above the wrist. A very thin piece of tubing is placed into the nose, through which ionic solutions are pumped. Response to each solution is recorded by an electrode feeding into a microvolt meter.

Responses to questions are coded as 1 = very true or always, 2 = mostly true or often, 3 = somewhat true or sometimes, and 4 = not at all true or never. Some items are reverse scored so that higher scores indicate increased ability and higher quality of life. For this study, a summary score will be calculated to provide a single quality of life value. The questionnaire for ages 12-13 includes 35 questions and total scores can range from 35 to 140. The questionnaire for ages 14 and older has 50 questions and total scores range from 50 to 200.

Biological
Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells
The active agent in CYP-001 is allogeneic mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-derived MSCs), which are produced using the proprietary Cymerus™ platform technology. Cymerus™ refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus™ process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique.

",      The investigators will conduct genetic comparisons between Turner Syndrome (TS) patients with      and without Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) to identify causative agents of BAV in people with      TS.      The investigators will correlate the patterns and prevalence of structural heart defects in      TS women with emerging molecular data to identify patients who are at high risk for      cardiovascular complications    ,"      Turner syndrome (TS) is a common chromosomal disorder that affects approximately 1 in 2500      live female births. Complete or partial monosomy of one of the X chromosomes in a female is      associated with various congenital heart defects (CHDs), which include aortic dilatation,      coarctation of aorta and BAV. Congenital cardiovascular defects related to CHD are the      leading cause of death in women with TS. The Turner Syndrome Network Registry (TRN Registry)      and genetic sample repository can address gaps in knowledge of CHD in TS by facilitating the      recognition of demographic and genetic patterns. TRN Registry-based research can improve      surveillance of TS patients who are at risk for CHD and provide valuable insight into genetic      components of CHD.      The investigators will recruit TS patients into the TRN Registry and obtain blood and/or      saliva samples after informed consent. The genetic diagnosis of TS will be confirmed using      chromosomal microarrays. The array data will be also be used to identify genomic copy number      variants, and rare variants in protein coding genes will be determined by exome sequencing.      The investigators will derive induced pluripotent stem cells from some participants to      determine why CHD is so prevalent in TS. CHD risk genes will be identified in comparisons      between TS cases with and without congenital heart defects. To facilitate these comparisons,      the investigators will abstract the demographic and medical data of registry participants      from questionnaires and medical records. Imaging will be used to confirm the diagnosis of CHD      and to determine the prevalence and severity of additional cardiovascular defects.    ",,"

","      Background Genetic factors play a major role in intellectual disability (ID) but the      underlying cause is not determined in many cases.      This proposal is the continuation of the previous interregional project HUGODIMS, the aim of      which was to perform whole exome sequencing (WES) in 69 thoroughly selected simplex ID      parent-child trios. Thanks to HUGODIMS consortium, the underlying genetic cause of ID was      determined or highly suspected in 48 cases (69.5%) and 7 novel ID genes were identified.      Hypothesis Investigators hypothesize that an approach combining genomics, transcriptomics,      metabolomics and morphological analyses performed on induced pluripotent stem cell      (iPSC)-derived neural cells would improve diagnosis of ID. The current proposal is therefore      a proof-of concept project aiming at assessing the relevance and effectiveness of this      multi-omics approach.      Aims and Methods Ten individuals with ID recruited through HUGODIMS, in whom WES have failed      to identify pathogenic variants will be included.      The workflow is the following:        1. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) (Nantes) of these 10 negative trios.        2. Bio-informatics analyses        3. In 3 WGS negative cases, 3 positive controls bearing distinct mutations in CAMK2a (a           novel ID gene identified thanks to HUGODIMS), and 3 healthy negative controls:             1. Derivation of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitors (iPSC                core facility at Nantes)             2. Targeted and non-targeted metabolomics analyses performed on iPSC-derived neuronal                cells (Angers)             3. RNA sequencing performed on the 9 cell lines (Rennes)             4. Morphological analyses of differentiated neuronal cell lines derived from 3                affected individuals and 3 positive controls bearing CMK2a mutations (Tours)             5. Integration and validation of data from multi-omics and morphological approaches      Expected results and impact Investigatrors expect that this approach combining multi-omics      and iPSC will help to improve diagnosis and understanding of genetic ID of unknown cause    ",,,"

","      In this study the investigators will seek to improve our understanding of how positive and      negative valence systems, cognition, and arousal/interoception are inter-related in disorders      of mood, substance use, and eating behavior. The investigators will recruit 1000 individuals      and use a wide range of assessment tools, neuroimaging measures, blood and microbiome      collections and behavioral tasks to complete the baseline and follow-up study visits. Upon      completion, the investigators aim to have robust and reliable dimensional measures that      quantify these systems and a set of assessments that should be recommended as a clinical tool      to enhance outcome prediction for the clinician and assist in determining who will likely      benefit from what type of intervention.    ","      Neuroscience has made tremendous progress in understanding the basic neural circuitry that      underlies important processes such as attention, memory, and basic emotion processing. Yet,      little progress has been made to utilize these insights to apply them to psychiatric      populations in order to make clinically meaningful predictions. The connection between      psychiatric disorders and their underlying neurobiology has been difficult to establish. The      overarching theme of this study is to determine how biological and objective behavioral      measures can contribute to improving assessment and treatment of psychiatric patients. The      investigators will use the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain      Criteria (RDoC) framework as a heuristic approach that integrates neuroscience and      psychopathology to study the positive and negative valence systems, cognition and      arousal/interoception domains. Within this framework we will study a group of treatment      seeking individuals with mental health conditions to determine how dysfunctions of affect,      substance use, and eating behavior organize across different levels and whether these latent      factors can be used to generate clinically useful prediction.      Using self-report, behavior, physiology, neural circuit, cell, molecule, and gene unit of      analysis measures, the investigators propose to enroll 1000 individuals from four different      cohorts over 5 years: (1) anxiety and/or depression; (2) eating problems; (3) substance use      problems; and (4) healthy controls. Each individual will undergo a multi-level assessment      that consists of (a) a standardized diagnostic assessment, (b) self-report questionnaires,      (c) behavioral tasks, (d) physiological measurements, (e) structural and functional magnetic      resonance imaging (fMRI) and EEG, (f) biomarker and microbiome assessments, (g) blood to      derive induced pluripotent stem cells, (h) and genetic and epigenetic assessments. These      individuals will be followed up for one year and will be re-assessed using a multi-domain      assessment of functioning, which will include: (a) symptom severity and duration, (b)      subjective well-being, (c) psychosocial function, (c) occupational function, (d) physical      health, (e) utilization of mental health resources (treatment), and (f) compliance with      treatment.

","      Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare genetic disease of innate immune due to the      malfunction of phagocytic cells unable to destroy pathogens during infection. The four genes      implicated are CYBB, CYBA, NCFA and NCF2 respectively encoding Nox2, p22phox, p47phox and      p67phox. Nox2 analogs have recently been discovered in cells other than phagocytes. So the      question arises on physiopathological impact of the absence of theses proteins not only in      phagocytes but also in other cells types such as fibroblasts or neurons.      The principal objective is thus to study the impact of protein deficits Nox2 and p22phox, in      the pathophysiology of neurons from inducible pluripotent bone marrow cells (iPSC).      For this purpose, a collection was built of fibroblasts and keratinocytes from patients with      different forms of CGD to get iPSC similar to embryonic marrow cells and differentiable into      several cell types (neurons, phagocytes).    ","      Non randomised pilot descriptive multicentric study. Since recently it has been shown that      Nox2p22phox protein is expressed not only in phagocytic cells but also in non-phagocytic      cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells ,vascular cells, neurons. If pathological      consequences of the deficiency Nox2 and p22phox, essential to the production of bactericidal      toxic derivatives at the level of phagocytic cells, is well documented, impact of their      absence in other types of non-phagocytic cells is not known. A better understanding of the      impact of the absence of these proteins in these tissues could improve the management of CGD      patients by providing a more specific monitoring of their condition. Similarly the formation      of different cell models of all genetic forms of CGD that do not exist at present will be of      great use to study the physiopathology of this disease and as tools for future studies.      The study requires the inclusion of minor subjects as CGD is usually diagnosed in early      childhood ( <2 years), it is rare (frequency 1/200 000) and the life expectancy is reduced.      To elaborate the cells collection, hair and skin biopsy are necessary. They will be performed      under local anesthesia for adults, and during a planned general anesthesia for minors.      Fibroblasts and keratinocytes in culture will be obtained by conventional control methods and      the absence of expression of p22phox or Nox2 will be checked.      Measurement of the kinetics of neuronal development and apoptosis iPSC will be performed in a      differentiation system 2 dimensions on stromal cells MS5. For that, markers of neuronal      differentiation of each step will be measured.      Measurement of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in phagocytes and p22phox deficient Nox2 from      differentiation from iPSC (chemiluminescence, flow cytometry) will be performed.      Measurement of the effectiveness of phagocytosis (phagocytic function) in phagocytes      deficient p22phox and Nox2 from differentiation from iPSC (flow cytometry) will be performed.      The absence of protein and p22phox Nox2 in phagocytes and p22phox deficient Nox2 from      differentiation from the iPSC (western blot, flow cytometry) will be verified.      Kinetic of transformation of fibroblasts derived from CGD patients with deficiency or p22phox      Nox2 in myofibroblasts will be measured.      To answer the principal objective of this study the recruitment of 10 patients will be      necessary.    ","

",      Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are adult cells that have been genetically      reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state by being forced to express genes and      factors important for maintaining the defining properties of embryonic stem cells. The      reprogramming of adult cells into embryonic stem (ES) cells enables the generation of      patient-specific stem cells and thus has enormous potential for the treatment and analysis of      degenerative diseases. In this project the investigators are going to induce pluripotent stem      cells from cell cultures from skin biopsies of patients. The iPS cells will be developed for      modeling diseases and drug discovery as well as basic research.    ,"      iPS cells are typically derived by transfection of certain stem cell-associated genes into      non-pluripotent cells, such as adult fibroblasts. Transfection is typically achieved through      viral vectors, such as retroviruses. Transfected genes include the master transcriptional      regulators Oct-3/4 (Pouf51) and Sox2, although to enhance the efficiency of induction some      other genes e.g. Klf4, c-Myc. In this study after separation the fibroblasts from patient's      skin biopsy, the cells are transfected with 4 Yamanaka factors (human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4,      c-Myc) after 3-4 weeks, transfected cells are isolated through morphological selection.

","      Bronchiectasis is a long-term lung condition where the airways become abnormally enlarged,      leading to a build-up of mucus and inflammation that makes the lungs more susceptible to      recurrent infection. Patients with bronchiectasis have subtle abnormalities in the way their      airway cells respond to infection that are, in part, responsible for the development of their      condition. At present there are no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis.      This study will aim to characterise in depth some of these abnormalities with a view to      future studies that will try to develop treatments that can directly target those      abnormalities at a molecular level.      Patients known to have bronchiectasis who have provided written informed consent will be      enrolled alongside healthy volunteers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease      and cystic fibrosis, for comparison. Participants will give a blood sample and have a      bronchoscopy. This is a thin telescopic tube, passed through the nose or mouth, under      sedation, into the airways that will allow a sample of bronchial epithelial cells to be      taken.      The main objective of the study is to achieve a greater understanding of some of the key      biological processes/pathways and disease marker genes that play a role in the development of      bronchiectasis. This is important because, at present, little is known about the underlying      disease mechanisms and there are no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis.      The investigator's hope this in-depth characterisation of specific bronchial epithelial cell      abnormalities in bronchiectasis will shed light on novel targets for future drug discovery.    ",,,"

",      This study proposes to carefully examine the hypothesis that human inducible pluripotent stem      cells (iPSCs) can be effectively employed as a future therapeutic option for individuals with      diabetic retinopathy and macular ischemia. iPSCs will be generated from the peripheral blood      cells of subjects with diabetes and age matched controls. The human iPSC cells will be used      to generate mesoderm cells for injection into the vitreous cavity of diabetic rodents and      primate eyes. The ability of mesoderm cells to generate endothelial cells and pericytes in      areas of degenerated capillaries will be examined. The human iPSCs will also be used to      generate hematopoietic CD34+CD45+ cells. The combination of CD34+CD45+ cells derived from      iPSCs and iPSC derived mesoderm will be examined in combination for their potentially      beneficial effect to enhance the vessel formation.    ,"      Vascular complications due to diabetes mellitus (DM) are the result of sustained vascular      injury with insufficient vascular repair. In chronic diabetes, vascular reparative mechanism      can be lost resulting in development of microvascular complications (MVC), such as diabetic      retinopathy (DR). We assessed the reparative function of progenitor cells that circulate in      the peripheral blood of diabetic individuals and found that the vascular wall-derived      progenitor cells, endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs), were depleted in diabetics with      MVC. Bone marrow-derived progenitor cells, CD45+CD34+ were dysfunctional in diabetics with      MVC. We found that human inducible pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)-derived ECFCs displayed      the ability to form functional and durable blood vessels in vivo and conferred therapeutic      revascularization by connecting with and remaining integrated with host rodent vessels long      term. We characterized a mesoderm subset (SSEA5-KNA+ cells) generated from hiPSCs that gives      rise to ECFCs. Finally, we used hiPSCs to generate CD34+CD45+ cells and tested the impact of      co-administration of these cells with ECFCs within the vitreous. The addition of CD34+CD45+      cells with ECFCs resulted in the enhanced survival, function and reparative ability of the      ECFCs. This beneficial effect was mediated by reducing retinal oxidative stress and      inflammation.      These novel and paradigm shifting findings led us to hypothesize: the hiPSC-derived-mesoderm      subset (SSEA5-KNA+) can be utilized for long term revascularization of vasodegenerative      capillaries and their reparative action can be further enhanced by coinjection of CD34+CD45+      cells that provide anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

","      1. INTRODUCTION Neurological and neurodegenerative diseases have a major impact in families           and in the national health service due to the lack in many cases of effective and           long-lasting therapies. The lack of these therapeutic strategies is due in large part to           the difficulty of modeling these pathologies in vitro. In fact, the impossibility of           being able to cultivate human neurons in vitro has forced the use of animal cell models           that do not adequately recapitulate the complexity of these human pathologies. For this           reason it is necessary to proceed with the development of in vitro models of human           origin that reproduce the molecular and biochemical characteristics of these diseases.           The discovery of cellular reprogramming allowed the generation of pluripotent stem cells           from the conversion of somatic cells taken from adult individuals. This technology is           based on the expression of the 4 genes OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC that synergistically           are sufficient to convert somatic cells into induced stem cells called iPS (1,2). For           this technology Prof. S. Yamanaka from the University of Kyoto was awarded the Nobel           Prize for Medicine in 2012 (3). Human iPS-induced stem cells can be maintained in vitro           in a stable manner over time and then be differentiated into any specialized cell           including neurons and glial cells. In this way, therefore, it is possible to generate           human neurons from adult individuals suffering from neurological pathologies, allowing           the study of pathophysiological mechanisms in cells affected by these diseases. Research           in recent years has established many reliable protocols to differentiate human iPS cells           into different subtypes of neurons (glutamatergics, GABAergics, dopaminergics),           astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglia (4-6). Thanks to these procedures it was           possible to generate neuronal and glial models of many neurological diseases by creating           very useful systems for studying pathological processes and identifying new therapeutic           targets for some genetic forms of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and autism (7-9).           The proposing group already has great experience in generating iPS cells by           reprogramming and in differentiating them into neurons and glias useful for neurological           disease cellular studies. As an example, Dr. Broccoli's group has generated iPS cells           from patients with Parkinson's disease and mutations in the OPA1 gene (8). The study of           neurons differentiated by these iPS cells allowed to identify mitochondrial defects at           the base of neuronal dysfunctions and to identify for the first time how the           degeneration of dopaminergic neurons also depends on a moving mode of cell death called           necroptosis (8).           The investigators therefore propose to establish lines of iPS cells from patients with           genetic mutations responsible for neurological and neurodegenerative diseases to           generate neuronal and glial models in vitro for the study of pathological mechanisms and           the validation of new future experimental therapies.        2. PURPOSE AND DRAWING OF THE STUDY The aim of this study is to generate iPS-induced stem           cell lines from patients with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases to           differentiate into neurons and glial cells to study the pathological cellular and           molecular processes of these diseases. These in vitro cultures will also be used to           validate molecules or experimental therapeutic approaches. IPS cells will be generated           by the reprogramming of isolated 10-mL cells of peripheral venous blood.      The study therefore involves taking 10 ml of peripheral blood from        1. Subjects carrying genetic mutations that condition the development of neurological and /           or neurodegenerative diseases.        2. Relatives or family control non-carriers of genetic mutations conditioning the           development of metabolic and / or neurodegenerative diseases (healthy donors).      3. EXPERIMENTAL PHASE        1. Following a Neurological visit, a Neurological Consultation is requested by the           Neurologist.        2. Genetic Counseling is performed and the molecular test to be performed is identified.           Classical diagnostic paths are applied according to specific national guidelines for           each pathology (SIGU: http://www.sigu.net/show/attivita/5/1/LINEE%20GUIDA%20SIGU) that           indicate the analysis of the most suitable to analyze and above all more frequently           involved.        3. A blood sample is taken after signing an informed consent form (informed consent           Neuromed version 12.02.2015) for the diagnostic study. Approximately 10 milliliters of           blood will be taken and subsequently a part will be fractionated in serum and           lymphocytes which will be stored at -80 ° C.        4. Molecular analyzes are carried out at the Center for Molecular Genetics of the IRCCS INM           Neuromed Institute through NGS or Sanger Sequencing, Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe           Amplification (MLPA) and Microsatellites.        5. If the molecular diagnosis has identified a gene and / or a variant of interest           compatible with the clinical phenotype, or has identified a variant with uncertain           clinical significance (VoUS), the real scientific importance of generating the patient's           iPS stem cells is evaluated in object        6. If the possibility of generating such cells is positively evaluated, during           consultation, at the same time as the withdrawal of the report, the patient is asked for           his consent (informed consent Neuromed version 12.02.2015) to participate in this           research protocol. A peripheral blood sample of 10 ml is performed.        7. Blood samples in tubes with EDTA as anticoagulant are sent by express courier to the           laboratory of Dr. Vania Broccoli at the San Raffaele Hospital (OSR) where the           mononuclear cells of the blood will be reprogrammed in iPS stem cells.        8. Part of the iPS stem cells generated in OSR will be sent to the NEUROMED to confirm the           pathological mutation and the correct cell genetic        9. iPS stem cells will be differentiated into neurons and glia for the study of the           pathological mechanisms underlying neuropathology.       10. iPS stem cell aliquots will be cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen both in OSR and in           NEUROMED to ensure the maintenance of the lines that will be maintained until the end of           the study.      4. MATERIALS AND METHODS Reprogramming of peripheral blood mononuclear cells Once the 10 ml      of peripheral venous blood is obtained, mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated and      reprogrammed using the Sendai RNA virus, which expresses the 4 genes SOX2, OCT4, KLF4 and      c-MYC without integrating in the cell genome. This operation will be performed in sterile BL2      rooms available at the laboratory of Dr. Vania Broccoli at the Neuroscience Division of the      San Raffaele Hospital in Milan.      Then the PBMCs will be then plated on a fibroblast mat in sterile 10 mm Petri dishes with a      culture medium enriched with the cytokine bFGF (4ng / ml) (8). In these culture conditions,      the first iPS reprogrammed stem cell clones will be visible after approximately 30 days. At      this point, the individual clones will be isolated and grown to amplify the number of cells      and establish proliferating lines. The progeny of the single clones will be studied to verify      the correct reprogramming in pluripotent stem cells through: 1) activation of marker genes of      the state of pluripotent staminality (Nanog, Sox2, Oct4, SEEA4), capacity of in vitro      differentiation in the somatic cells of the three sheets embryonic endoderm, mesoderm and      ectoderm, minimal contamination of differentiated cells in the culture. Once the induced      pluripotent stem cell generation (iPS) has been validated, the cells will be used to be      differentiated into different neuronal and glial types for experiments aimed at understanding      and describing the pathogenetic mechanisms of the subject's study diseases. For the      generation of neurons will be followed the protocol developed by Shi and colleagues (5) that      uses retinoic acid and TGFbeta / BMP proteins inhibitors to direct the neuroectodermal      differentiation. This procedure has already been validated and used in our laboratories      demonstrating the differentiation of iPS stem cells into mature and functioning neurons (10)      (Figure 1).      Once the processes of differentiation with iPS stem cells have been established, the      investigators will proceed with the analysis of the phenotype in the patients' cells with      respect to controls derived from healthy controls. In particular, with regard to the analyzes      in neurons, survival parameters will be investigated, neuronal activity through      electrophysiological recordings, mitochondrial morphology and metabolism, endoplasmic      reticulum stress, and synapse formation and functioning. For glial cells the levels of      inflammation including the activity of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6 and NOS proteins will      be analyzed. Along with these studies, a genomic analysis will be carried out by comparing      the gene expression profiles of neurons and glial cells. The analysis will be done for      RNA-Seq, a ""next-generation sequencing"" technique that allows to analyze the expression      levels of all genes in the genome. The genes thus identified will be validated with real-time      PCR analysis and their functioning will be investigated in neurons and cells derived from the      patient's cells.      5. STATISTICS For the study of pathological processes 6 lines of iPS cells will be derived      from each patient and healthy individual. The investigators anticipate from our previous      experience that the comparison between this number of lines between patient and healthy donor      is more than sufficient to have statistical significance for the different in vitro      experiments that will be performed. In case it will be possible to generate new lines of iPS      cells from the same patient in the unlikely event it was necessary.      6. ETHICAL ASPECTS The procedures reported in the study concerning conducting, conducting and      documentation are designed to ensure that the ethical principles set forth in the Helsinki      Declaration and its revisions are upheld. The study will be conducted taking into account      regulatory requirements and legal obligations. In particular, the normative reference is      represented by the DL n.211, 24/06/2003 and DM 17/12/2004 on non-profit studies. Furthermore,      before enrollment, all potentially eligible patients will receive complete and comprehensive      information on the study. In order to be enrolled it will be necessary that the patients      consent to the participation in the study and processing of personal data, according to the      law 196/03 on the protection of persons and the processing of personal data. The informed      consent previously approved by the ethics committee will be used.      7. FINAL OBJECTIVES This program aims to identify the sub-cellular processes altered exactly      in human cells (neurons and i) affected by the neuropathologies in question. Furthermore,      this study will also allow us to integrate molecular data with the aim of identifying genes      whose specific alterations may underlie these cellular dysfunctions. The ultimate aim of this      experimental program is to identify the alteration of specific molecular mechanisms      underlying these diseases. These new knowledge will be essential to think about the      development of new translational strategies based on pharmacological approaches or gene      therapy. This is of great importance since the diseases in question are orphans of effective      treatment and limited to exclusively symptomatic treatments.      8. PROJECT COSTS Molecular diagnostics is performed routinely at the Molecular Genetics      Center of IRCCS Neuromed. There are no additional costs as the analyzes are part of      diagnostic procedures carried out in agreement with the NHS.      IPS generation is performed by IRCCS San Raffaele. The costs for the development of these      lines are therefore completely dependent on them.    ",,"

Eligibility:      Healthy volunteers and patients ages 18 and older      Design:      First-time research study participants at NIH will have an initial visit for this study that      should last no more than 1 hour. All other visits should last 20 30 minutes.      Participants will undergo a limited history and physical exam.      Participants may have routine blood and urine tests.      If participants are giving a blood sample, they must have a hemoglobin level checked in the      past 12 months to make sure it is safe for them to give a blood sample for research.      Participants may have a venous blood collection. They may do this at several visits. They      will lie on a recliner or couch or sit in a chair.

This protocol defines in      general terms the purposes for which blood, urine and ultrafiltrate will be collected by      members of the NIH s Clinical Center (CC), Critical Care Medicine Department (CCMD) and      collaborating institutions and establishes general conditions under which sampling will be      performed.

","      Craniosynostosis (CS) is a common malformation occurring in ~4 per 10,000 live births in      which the sutures between skull bones close too early, causing long-term problems with brain      and skull growth. Infants with CS typically require extensive surgical treatment and may      experience many perioperative complications, including hemorrhage and re-synostosis. Even      with successful surgery, children can experience developmental and learning disabilities or      vision problems. Most often, CS appears as isolated nonsyndromic CS (NSC). Of the several      subtypes of CS, unilateral or bilateral fusion of the coronal suture is the second most      common form of CS accounting for 20-30% of all NSC cases. The etiology of coronal NSC (cNSC)      is not well understood, although the published literature suggests that it is a      multifactorial condition. About 5-14% of coronal craniosynostosis patients have a positive      family history, with a specific genetic etiology identified in >25% of cNSC cases, suggesting      a strong genetic component in the pathogenesis of this birth defect. The causes for cNSC and      its phenotypic heterogeneity remain largely unknown. An international team of investigators      will generate large genomic and gene expression datasets on samples from patients with cNSC.      State-of-the-art imaging, genetic, and developmental and systems biology approaches will be      used to quantitatively model novel pathways and networks involved in the development of cNSC.      Novel variant-, gene- and network-level analyses will be performed on the genomic data      obtained from cNSC cases, their relatives, and controls to identify novel variants and      genetic regions associated with cNCS. Quantitative, analytical, and functional validations of      these predictions will provide insights into the etiology and possible therapeutic targets      for CS and potentially other bone-related disorders.    ","      The long-term goal of the Program Project, Craniosynostosis Network, is to elucidate normal      and abnormal craniofacial biology to ultimately improve the treatment of craniofacial      disorders. Craniosynostosis and other skull abnormalities are among the most common human      malformations usually requiring surgical and medical intervention. The Network will integrate      three projects and two cores. Scientists with diverse expertise including anthropology,      morphometry, imaging, birth defects, developmental biology, genetics, genomics, epidemiology,      statistics, and systems biology will explore the determinants of the fate of the relevant      mesenchymal progenitor cells, abnormalities in osteogenesis that contribute to global skull      growth abnormality and premature closure of cranial sutures, especially the coronal suture.      High quality genomic data will be obtained from patients with coronal nonsyndromic      craniosynostosis (cNSC) and their available parents. Novel genome-wide variant-, gene- and      network-level analyses will be performed on these families to identify novel variants and      genetic regions associated with coronal craniosynostosis.      This study is a multi-center, open-enrollment, retrospective study, employing both      family-based and case-control study designs.      Approximately 4000 cNSC patients, their family members, and controls will be recruited by      Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the majority will be recruited from the more than      10 collaborating institutions worldwide.

","      Hereditary cardiac arrhythmias (genetically caused disturbances of heart rhythm) are life      threatening conditions affecting otherwise healthy young individuals. Due to the      inaccessibility of heart tissue, the abnormal electrical current(s) in the heart cells      causing the rhythm disturbance can be difficult to study in detail and therefore in many      cases remain untreatable. The investigators propose to study heart cell electrical function      from such patients by reprogramming skin cells to become stem cells and then differentiating      them to heart muscle cells.      The hypothesis of the study is that the differentiated cardiac cells will display electrical      abnormalities dependent on the mutation causing the disease. These abnormalities can      therefore provide a clue as to the nature of the mutation causing the disease or information      about its effective management    ",,,"

",,"      Background:      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the United      States. Currently, there is no safe way to obtain cells from the eye to study. But      researchers now can turn other types of cells, like skin or blood, into induced pluripotent      stem (iPS) cells. These can be grown in a lab and turned into other types of cells, like      cells from the eye. This will allow researchers to understand and treat diseases of the eye      such as AMD.      Objectives:      To establish a bank of samples that can be changed into other cell types, such as eye cells,      to better understand diseases such as AMD. Also to test drugs in order to treat various eye      diseases.      Eligibility:      People who provided DNA samples in another protocol (07-EI-0025)      Design:      Participants will be screened with their data from the previous protocol. Participants with      select genetic variants will be chosen and contacted via phone.      Participants will have a punch skin biopsy. The skin will be washed. A numbing medication      will be injected. A small piece of skin will be removed with a biopsy tool. The site will be      covered with a dressing. They will receive instructions on how to care for the area. They      will have follow-up visits if needed for clinical care for the area.      Participants may be asked to return if their first sample did not provide enough cells for      the lab.      Participants sample will be developed into eye cells. The cells will be used to understand      diseases and test new drugs.    ","      Objective: This ancillary study will establish a repository of biospecimens to generate      induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that can be differentiated into ocular cell types, to be      used for study of molecular mechanisms of and development of treatments for age-related      macular degeneration (AMD). This repository will allow the cells to be used to perform high      throughput drug screens to identify novel potential therapeutic compounds. Although research      involving multiple different ocular cell types from these patients may be performed, the vast      majority of the work will be centered on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and neural      retina. RPE and/or neural retinal cells generated from the iPS cells of participants with AMD      will be used to analyze molecular mechanisms involved in disease initiation and progression.      Study Population: We plan to recruit 100 participants across multiple sites with AMD from the      original cohort of study participants enrolled in the AREDS2 who are returning for a 10 year      in-clinic study visit and have donated DNA in the AREDS2 study. Up to two participants will      be enrolled at NEI. Participants with the highest genetic burden as well as those with rare      variants will be included in the population.      Design: A 520 blood sample will be collected from 350 participants with specific genetic      variants that are identified prior to the start of the study. Up to 60 participants will be      enrolled at NEI. All of these participants were previously enrolled in the AREDS2 protocol      (07-EI-0025) and they are returning for a 10-year in-clinic study visit for further      phenotyping and for assessing the long-term effects of the ARESD2 supplements. Collected      samples will be used to analyze molecular mechanisms involved in disease initiation and      progression. In addition, the iPS cell-derived ocular cells may be used to perform high      throughput (HTP) drug screens aimed at suppressing the molecular phenotypes of the disease      and to identify potential therapeutic agents for these diseases. This study will typically      require only one visit by each participant.      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is to develop a repository for iPS cells for      investigators involved in vision research. Secondary outcomes include the assessment of      potential therapies for the treatment of age related macular disorder (AMD). There are no      specific participant-based clinical outcomes for this protocol. Participants will, in      general, be seen only once for this protocol, as this is an ancillary study to the main      study.    ",,"

","      Background:      - Researchers are interested in studying individuals who have known or suspected metabolic or      genetic diseases that put them at a high risk for heart diseases or diseases of their blood      vessels. To improve the results of the study, both affected and nonaffected individuals will      be asked to provide blood and other samples and will undergo tests to evaluate heart and lung      function. Nonaffected individuals will include relatives of affected individuals and healthy      nonrelated volunteers.      Objectives:      - To study individuals who have or are at risk for cardiovascular diseases, as well as their      unaffected relatives and healthy volunteers.      Eligibility:      - Individuals between 1 and 100 years of age. Participants may be healthy volunteers,      individuals with cardiovascular diseases, or unaffected relatives of individuals with      cardiovascular diseases.      Design:        -  Participants will have some or all of the following tests, as directed by the study           researchers:        -  Photography of the face and full body        -  Body measurements        -  Radiography, including chest or limb x-rays        -  Metabolic stress testing to study heart and muscle function        -  Echocardiography to study heart function        -  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, including cardiovascular MRI, angiography, and           contrast MRI, to study heart function and performance        -  Computed tomography (CT) angiogram to obtain images of the heart and lungs        -  Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to study possible fat infiltration of the           heart        -  Six-minute walk test to study heart, lung, and muscle function and performance        -  Vascular ultrasound to study blood vessel walls        -  Blood, tissue, and other specimens will be collected for research and testing, and will           be taken either as part of the clinical study or during surgical procedures.        -  Follow-up studies may be performed under separate research protocols.    ","      We propose to characterize the etiology and natural history of rare and uncommon diseases,      both known and unknown that present with symptoms and signs associated with the risk of overt      or potential cardiovascular dysfunction. We will also study rare genetic modifiers and      identify novel disease mechanisms contributing to common cardiovascular diseases. In so      doing, we will expand our knowledge about these disorders and provide access to subjects of      interest for research, teaching, and clinical experience. Individual subjects seen under this      protocol may initiate the establishment of specific disease-related protocols involving      intensive natural history studies, disease discovery and potential innovative therapeutic      studies. In addition to its role in investigating individuals who are of interest to the      Cardiovascular Branch (CB) of the NHLBI, this protocol can provide a possible avenue for      admitting subjects from other NIH programs such as the NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program, the      Center for Human Immunology Trans-institute program or other NIH protocols where subjects      exhibit cardiovascular features.

Researchers have been           able to determine the specific genetic mutations involved in tuberous sclerosis, and as           a result are interested in studying the genetic information of children who have both           tuberous sclerosis and autism, as well as tuberous sclerosis without autism.      Objectives:      - To develop a collection of DNA samples from blood and skin samples taken from children with      autism and/or tuberous sclerosis, as well as healthy volunteers.      Eligibility:        -  Children between 4 to 18 years of age who have autism and/or tuberous sclerosis, or are           healthy volunteers.        -  Some of the healthy volunteers will be siblings of children with autism.

","      The aim of this protocol is to provide further elucidation of the clinical phenotype of      autism, and second to characterize a potential cellular phenotype through the re-programming      of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). The scope of autistic      spectrum disorders (ASD) is defined by its behavioral symptoms, encompassing a group of      conditions that includes Asperger disorder, autism and pervasive developmental disorder-not      otherwise specified (PDD). The clinical presentation of each of these diagnostic groups      differs slightly, but all share three common features: deficits in social reciprocity, delays      or deficits in communication (both verbal and non-verbal) and presence of repetitive      behaviors and fixated interests. These symptoms are most pronounced in the autism group, so      they will serve as the subjects for this pilot investigation. Individual differences in      behavioral symptoms, genetic abnormalities, medical comorbidities and other risk factors will      be assessed. These approaches will be coupled with computational approaches to identify      neural networks by analysis of gene association study data, and analysis of gene databases to      relate the diagnostic criteria of autism by unbiased analysis of the ontology of genes      relevant to CNS function.

Doctors cannot safely obtain retinal cells to study these diseases. However,      cells collected from hair follicles, skin, and blood can be used for research. Researchers      want to collect cells from people with Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD, and compare their cells      with those of healthy volunteers.      Objectives:      - To collect hair, skin, and blood samples to study three eye diseases that affect the      retina: Best disease, L-ORD, and AMD.      Eligibility:        -  Individuals affected with ocular condition is one year of age or older.        -  Individuals affected with Best disease, L-ORD, or AMD is 18 years of age or older.        -  Unaffected individuals are seven years of age or older.      Design:        -  The study requires one visit to the National Eye Institute.        -  Participants will be screened with a medical and eye disease history. They will also           have an eye exam.        -  Participants will provide a hair sample, a blood sample, and a skin biopsy. The hair           will be collected from the back of the head, and the skin will be collected from the           inside of the upper arm.    ","      This study will establish a repository of biospecimens to generate induced pluripotent stem      (iPS) cells, which will be used to determine molecular mechanisms for potentially blinding      eye diseases including but not limited to: Best Vitelliform Dystrophy (Best Disease);      Late-Onset Retinal Degeneration (L-ORD); Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD); Leber      congenital amaurosis (LCA); Joubert syndrome; X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP);      oculocutaneous albinism; Stargardt s with ABCA4 gene mutations; Waardenburg syndrome,      coloboma, Enhanced S-Cone syndrome (ESCS), Spinocerebellar Ataxia, Type 7 (SCA7) and eye      diseases associated with MITF, PAX2, or PAX6 gene mutations. Skin fibroblasts, saliva, hair      keratinocytes, and/or blood cells may be collected from participants with retinal diseases      and from age, gender and ethnicity-matched healthy participants.      Although research involving multiple different ocular cell types from these patients may be      performed, the vast majority of the work will be centered on the retinal pigment epithelium      (RPE) and neural retina. RPE and/or neural retinal cells generated from the iPS cells of      participants with retinal diseases and healthy volunteers will be used to analyze molecular      mechanisms involved in disease initiation and progression. In addition, the iPS cell-derived      ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput (HTP) drug screens aimed at suppressing      the molecular phenotypes of the disease and to identify potential therapeutic agents for      these diseases.      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to generate participant-iPS cells that can      be differentiated into ocular cell types, to be used to study the molecular mechanisms of and      to develop treatments for ocular conditions. This objective will be carried out in three      phases. First, this study will establish a repository of fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and/or      blood cells collected from participants with eye diseases and from matched controls without      any eye diseases. Second, the somatic cell repository will be used to generate iPS cells,      which will be differentiated into RPE, neural retinal and/or other ocular cells. These cells      will be used to elucidate molecular pathways that have led to disease pathogenesis. In the      third phase, the participant-specific ocular cells will be used to perform high throughput      drug screens to identify novel potential therapeutic compounds. The cells obtained in this      protocol may be genetically modified, may be transplanted into animals in the laboratory,      and, if used in the development of cell-based therapies, may be transplanted into humans.      Transplantation into humans will be done as a part of a different study.      Study Population: We plan to recruit 465 participants with ocular conditions including but      not limited to: degenerative retinal diseases, optic atrophy, microphthalmia/anophthalmia,      ciliopathy, and other ocular developmental or degenerative conditions, and 465 healthy      volunteers without any eye disease. If possible, unaffected siblings and relatives of      participants with eye diseases will be included as healthy volunteers.      Design: In this basic science, research-oriented study, skin, saliva, hair, and/or blood      samples may be collected from affected participants with the eye diseases and/or genetic      mutations under study, and from control participants matched for age, gender and ethnicity.      The sample collection procedures will incur only minimal risk to adult participants. Offsite      minor participants will not undergo the skin biopsy. This study will typically require only      one visit by each participant. Participants may be requested to return if their initial      sample(s) did not produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory. Participants who were      previously enrolled to provide samples for research-grade iPS cell generation may return for      an additional visit to provide samples for clinical-grade iPS cell generation, if eligible.      The skin fibroblast, keratinocyte, and/or blood samples will then be used to generate      participant-specific iPS cells, and these cells will then be differentiated into RPE, neural      retinal and/or other ocular cell types. iPS cells may not be made from all samples. The      investigators will use the samples for research studies aimed at identifying molecular and      signaling pathways underlying disease onset and progression and for developing potential      therapeutic treatments for the eye diseases under study.      Outcome Measures: The outcome measures for this study include the creation of iPS cells from      at least one of the three types of somatic tissues collected from each participant, the      differentiation of iPS cells into RPE, neural retinal cells and/or other ocular cells, and      the identification of molecular and physiological phenotypes in these cells that may be      linked to the onset or progression of the ocular conditions being studied. This analysis may      lead to the discovery of therapeutic interventions for these diseases. There are no specific      participant-based clinical outcomes for this protocol. Participants will, in general, be seen      only once for this protocol, as they will be ascertained and/or receiving standard care under      the NEI Ocular Natural History Protocol (16-EI-0134) or other NEI protocols. In rare cases,      participants may be requested to return to the clinic if their initial sample(s) did not      produce adequate cells for study in the laboratory.    ",,"

Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal             guardian to do so if they are minor children or have a legally authorized             representative if they are adults without consent capacity.          2. Participant meets one of the following criteria:               1. Participant has been diagnosed with an ocular condition of interest including but                  not limited to: degenerative retinal diseases, optic atrophy,                  microphthalmia/anophthalmia, ciliopathy, and other ocular developmental or                  degenerative conditions.               2. Participant is free of eye diseases and could serve as an unaffected control.                  Participant s age, gender, and ethnicity must match an existing participant with                  one of the eye diseases under study. Control participants matched to AMD                  participants must not have drusen greater than 63 microns in size.          3. Adult participant is able to provide a punch skin biopsy and 30 mL of peripheral             venous blood OR child participant is able to provide a punch skin biopsy and the             lesser of 5 mL/kg or 30 mL of peripheral venous blood. Healthy, unaffected children             will only have one skin punch biopsy done 3mm or less in size. In affected             participants, an additional punch may be gathered if the initial sample does not             contain adequate cells. This will be taken from children ages seven years and older.             Sampling of ten occipital hairs and/or saliva may be pursued at the investigator s             discretion. As a rule, samples will be collected on non-sedated/anesthetized             participants. Sedation/anesthesia will NOT be used solely for the purpose of sample             collection. In rare instances where a minor requires sedation for another medically             indicated procedure, samples may be collected at the time of sedation/anesthesia.             Because young children may not be able to cooperate with sample collection, those             unable to provide a skin biopsy and a blood sample may be excluded from the study,             based on the judgment of the examining investigator.          4. Participant meets one of the following criteria:               1. Participant affected with an ocular condition is one year of age or older.               2. Participant affected with Best disease, L-ORD, or AMD is 18 years of age or                  older.               3. Unaffected participant is seven years of age or older and willing and able to                  provide assent.        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:        A participant is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria are present.          1. Participant is unable to comply with study procedures.          2. Participant has a systemic disease that, in the opinion of the investigator,             compromises the ability to provide adequate samples. Examples of co-existing diseases             that would exclude a participant include a bleeding diathesis or a genetic             susceptibility to infections, particularly cutaneous infections.        ADDITIONAL CRITERIA FOR CLNICAL-GRADE CELL LINE GENERATION:        The additional eligibility criteria must be met for participants donating samples for the        generation of clinical-grade cell lines.        Inclusion Criteria          1. Participant must be greater than 18 years of age, as of the date of enrollment. There             is no upper age limit for donor enrollment.          2.

","      Hereditary neurological disorders are relatively common in paediatric neurological practice,      but it has considerable overlap with adult neurological disorders. It is a group of of      genetic diseases, most of which with a Mendelian inheritance affecting neurological system.      Pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases are not fully understood. There is currently no      effective therapy for most of these diseases. Disease-specific and patient- specific iPS      cells would provide useful source of cells in culture modeling in these diseases.      In this study, disease-specific iPS cell lines repositories from hereditary neurological      disease patients will be established. The cell lines will be registered and make them      available to other investigators.    ","      The human iPS is generated by direct reprogramming of human somatic cells. These hiPS cells      can give rise to most tissue types in the human embryo and possess many of the properties of      human embryonic stem cells (hESC). The big advantage of human iPS cell over hESC is that it      circumvents most of the limitations of hESC and remains the pluripotency for regeneration of      cells and tissues. The unique capacity of self-renewal of iPS can provide unlimited supply of      pluripotent stem cells for study. The patient-specific iPS cell lines should fundamentally      eliminate the concern of immune rejection and ethical issues. The disease-specific iPS will      facilitate the study of the mechanism of nucleotide expansion. It is the ideal medium to      study the dynamic changes of the expansion from stem cell stage to different differentiation      stages. It also creates a platform for drug development. The establishment of iPS stem cells      will also make it realistic for target gene replacement/correction therapy.      Study subjects will be identified at the members from the Hong Kong Spinocerebellar ataxias      (SCA) association and neurology clinic in Prince of Wales Hospital. Patients identify based      on the diagnosis, genetic test results and inclusion and exclusion criteria.      10ml blood sample for genetic screening will be collected. Skin biopsy will only be scheduled      if pathogenic mutation was identified by the genetic screening test and generation of iPS is      considered necessary to study the pathogenic mechanism of the disease.
