METHODS      Clinical Procedure      Pre-operative planning is based on clinical and radiographic examination. After thoroughly      recording the case history. The following investigations will be done prior to implant      placement surgery: CBCT, CBP, CT, BT, Hg%, RBS, Vital signs and other relevant      investigations. If all the parameters fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the      patient's impressions are made and study models poured. Intraoral and extraoral photographs      are taken. The surgical guide is constructed on the diagnostic models.Stem cells are carried      from stem cell bank to the Department of Implantology in a cryovial, safely placed in the      special device, which contains dry ice, to maintain the viability of stem cells.      Surgical Procedure      On the day of surgery, the dental operatory is thoroughly fumigated and all the infection      control protocols are followed.The participants will be receiving oral and written      information about the study and shall be providing the informed consent along with      photography and videography waiver consent. Antimicrobial prophylaxis (amoxicillin 1gm) and      antihistamine prophylaxis (20mg cetirizine) orally 1 hour before surgery should be given to      the patient. The universal precautions protocol is followed to protect yourself, the patients      and the dental assistant.The patient is asked to rinse the Oral cavity with chlorhexidine      gluconate solution (0.2%) for 1 minute before surgery.      IMPLANT PLACEMENT ON THE CONTROL SIDE      To standardized the protocol the patient's right side is selected as the control side and      left side as the test side. The surgical procedure is carried out under local anesthesia      containing 2% epinephrine with 1:100,000 epinephrine. The surgical guide is placed on the      teeth and is used to mark the position of the implant with round drill till it hits the bone.      Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised with mid crestal incision and intrasulcular incision      extending to one tooth mesially and other teeth distally. After full thickness flap      elevation, the osteotomy sites are prepared using the drilling sequence instructed by the      manufacturer.The dental implants Nobel Biocare Replace select (4.3 *10mm size) 4.3mm diameter      and 10mm length is selected and placed in the osteotomy site with IF of 40 Ncm.Before      approximation of the flap, the primary stability of the implant is recorded with the ostell      device, which has a transducer attached to the device and a magnetic attachment smart peg is      attached to the implant with a plastic peg holder each implant is measured twice from two      different angles,around 90 degrees and parallel to the crestal line.The two measurements      buccolingually and mesiodistally are recorded and an average of both the values are taken.The      measurements values are then transferred into implant stability quotient (ISQ) units, which      are given on a scale of 1- 100, with 100 being the highest degree of stability and it works      on the principle of resonance frequency analysis (RFA).The smart peg is removed and Healing      abutments are placed over the dental implants. The flap is sutured monofilament sutures 4-0.      IOPAR are taken with KKD Radiograph system, which standardizes the distance between the      collimator and the IOPAR.      IMPLANT PLACEMENT ON THE TEST SIDE      To standardized the protocol the patient's left side is chosen as the test side.The surgical      procedure is carried out under local anesthesia containing 2% epinephrine with 1:100,000      epinephrine. The surgical guide is placed on the teeth and is used to mark the position of      the implant with round drill till it hits the bone. Mucoperiosteal flaps were raised with mid      crestal incision and intrasulcular incision extending to one tooth mesially and another tooth      distally. After full thickness flap elevation, the osteotomy sites are prepared using the      drilling sequence instructed by the manufacturer. the stem cells are centrifuged in a sterile      environment as per the instructions are given by the stem cell bank.(Thawing protocol )Human      mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) are primary cells which can be successfully used for infusion      purpose.The following is the recommended protocol for thawing and infusion of these      cells:Remove the Cryovial of stem cells from dry ice,defrost the vial containing stem cells      by placing in between both the palms with constant, moderate agitation, until ice in the      ampule is no longer visible,immediately disinfect the vial with 70% isopropanol.Working under      laminar flow hood, open the vial and transfer the contents to a sterile 15ml centrifuge tube      and centrifuge at 3500 RPM for 5 minutes. Decant the supernatant and to the pellet add 1 ml      of saline.Mix properly and the cells are ready for infusion at the osteotomy site. Remove the      contents in a sterile dappen dish and before infusion of stem cells at the osteotomy site the      implant is dipped in the solution for 3 minutes so that the stem cells adhere to the titanium      implant surface. The same dental surgeon performs all the cases. The dental implants Nobel      Biocare Replace select (4.3 *10mm size) 4.3mm diameter and 10mm length is selected and placed      in the osteotomy site with IF of 40 Ncm11.Before approximation of the flap, the primary      stability of the implant is recorded with the ostell device, which has a transducer attached      to the device and a magnetic attachment smart peg is attached to the implant with a plastic      peg holder each implant is measured twice from two different angles,around 90 degrees and      parallel to the crestal line.The two measurements buccolingually and mesiodistally are      recorded and an average of both the values are taken.The measurements values are then      transferred into implant stability quotient (ISQ) units, which are given on a scale of 1-      100, with 100 being the highest degree of stability and it works on the principle of      resonance frequency analysis (RFA).The smart peg is removed and Healing abutments are placed      over the dental implants. The flap is sutured monofilament sutures 4-0.IOPAR are taken with      KKD radiograph system, which standardizes the distance between the collimator and the IOPAR.      POST SURGICAL TREATMENT      The patient is advised to take soft diet for one week and not to spit and rinse for the next      24 hours. Antibiotics, Antihistamines, and NSAIDs must be continued for 3 days. Postoperative      edema if any must be controlled with corticosteroids. The sutures are removed one week      postoperatively.      Recall visits      Weekly recall of the patient for 12 weeks for evaluation and recording of implant stability      measurements with Ostell ISQ device. Patient safety measures are evaluated on every visit      like unusual pain, swelling, allergic reaction, inflammation, outgrowth, vital signs, blood      assay or any unspecific reactions should be noted down. The emergency contact number is      provided to the patient to report any abnormal incidence immediately. The prosthetic part of      the treatment is to be carried out after 3 months either with removable or fixed      rehabilitation.      Statistical analysis      Descriptive statistics will be computed to summarize the data for its central tendency and      dispersion. Two sample t-test will be applied to see the mean change in the outcome variable      between experimental and control groups. Repeated measures of ANOVA are being applied to see      the time changes between experimental and control groups. Where ever data is not following      uniformity, either transforming the data or nonparametric statistical technique will be      applied. The analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS Version 19.0.    ",,"

","Determination of Implant Stability with RFA3 monthsDental Implant stability is a measure of primary stability and secondary stability.The Implant stability can be perceived as a combination of Mechanical stability, which is the result of compressed bone holding the implant tightly in place (Primary Stability) and biological stability, which is the result of new bone cells forming at the site of the implant and resultant osseointegration(Secondary stability).The Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) is a scale of measurement developed by Osstell device for use with the Resonance Frequency Analysis (RFA) method of measuring implant stability. The Implant Stability Quotient is a linear mapping from resonance frequency measured in kHz to the more clinically useful scale of 1-100 ISQ. The higher the ISQ, the more stable is the implant. The Implant stability is measured every fortnight for three months in 10 patients.The values on test side and control side are plotted on the graph and analysed.",,"

","      In this study we want to evaluate the clinical use of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC),      obtained from bone marrow of healthy donors, for treatment of Degenerative Disc Disease      (DDD). The trial is based in previous results with autologous MSC (Orozco et al.,      Transplantation 92: 822-828; 2011). Here we propose a phase I-II trial, prospective,      randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment DDD using MSV, a Good Manufacturing      Practice (GMP)-compliant expanded bone marrow MSC (MSV, PEI Num. 10-134).

WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index): Questionnaire to quantify the pain, stiffness and physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee or hip.
SF-12 (Short Form 12, an abbreviated form of SF36) is a questionnaire for the detection of changes in quality of life.
The visual analogue scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used for subjective measurements of knee pain.
LEQUESNE algofunctional index: is a composite measure of pain and disability, with specific self-report questionnaires for knee (osteoarthritis).
All the scale ranges ranges (minimum and maximum scores) are between 0 and 100%.
Values are given in differences from baseline (usually negative values). More negative values show more improvement on both scales.

",      Double-blind placebo randomized controlled trial evaluating the clinical efficacy of      allogenic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in cirrhotic patients with      acute-on-chronic liver failure    ,"      Introduction: The most important cause of death in patients with cirrhosis is the development      of Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF), a syndrome recently redefined with high mortality.      The only effective treatment for ACLF is liver transplantation. However, available organs are      limited. Other treatments, such as artificial liver support systems, do not improve survival.      ACLF is characterized by increased systemic inflammatory state together with impaired liver      regeneration what leads to multiorgan failure. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is an      attractive strategy for ACLF owing to the immunomodulatory and regenerative properties of      these cells. Aim: To investigate the effects of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs transplantation      on liver and other organ functions and systemic inflammation in patients with ACLF. Altruist      bone marrow donors will be the source of MSCs. Design and methodology: randomized,      double-blind phase I placebo-controlled trial aimed at comparing placebo (solution without      cells) and MSCs (4 doses of 2 x 106/kg administered on days 1, 4, 11 and 18). Thirty      patients, 15 per group will be included. ACLF will be defined by the CLIF SOFA score and      patients stratified according to severity. Outcomes evaluated will be: 1) Organ function      (CLIF SOFA and CLIF-C ACLF score); 2) Liver (Child-Pugh and MELD scores,serum bile acids,      ammonia and lactate levels), circulatory (systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics, renin,      noradrenalin) and endothelial function (nitric oxide, von Willebrand factor); 3 Inflammatory      response (serum cytokine panel and transcriptomic analysis of monocytes and polymorphonuclear      cells from peripheral blood); 4) Survival at 28 days, 3 and 12 months; and 5) Safety.      Expected results: Therapy with MSCs could have beneficial effects on the evolution of      patients with ACLF (modulation of inflammatory response and improvement of liver and      extra-hepatic organ function) what could translate into an improvement on short-term      survival.

","      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem      cells (MSC) for the treatment of patients who have developed an extensive chronic graft      versus host disease (with skin and/or liver damage) after HSCs transplantation and do not      respond to first-line therapy.      The secondary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)      on one-year survival rate, long-term survival rate, life quality and recurrence of patients      who have developed an extensive chronic graft versus host disease (with skin and/or liver      damage) after HSCs transplantation and do not respond to hormone treatment.    ","      Chronic Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)， with the incidence of 30%-60%, is a serious late      complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is the major      cause of death in the late stage of transplantation. According to targeted organs, cGVHD is      divided into two types, limited cGVHD and extensive cGVHD. Extensive cGVHD needs systemic      immunosuppressant treatment. However, currently standard first-line regimen including      cyclophosphamide and prednisolone is only effective for some patients. Novel treatment is      urgently needed. Our previous study has shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are      effective for cGVHD patients with multiple skin damage. To further explore the therapeutic      effect of MSCs for extensive cGVHD, we plan to conduct a multi-center clinical trial.      Patients who developed an extensive cGVHD (with skin and/or liver damage) after HSCs      transplantation and do not respond to first-line therapy are enrolled. They will be randomly      divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and routine second-line drugs respectively.      We will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSCs for extensive cGVHD by comparison of symptom      improvement, survival rate, recurrence as well as side effects in the two groups.    ",,"

",      The study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous administration of      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells for patients with refractory primary biliary      cirrhosis (PBC).    ,"      Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an organ-specific inflammatory disease and characterized      by immune mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts, then lead to liver cirrhosis and      eventually failure.Currently, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is the only drug approved by the      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Novel treatment is urgently needed for patients who have      an incomplete response to UDCA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent a promising tool for      cell-based therapies of autoimmune diseases. To explore the therapeutic effect of MSCs for      PBC, the investigators plan to conduct an open-label, randomized clinical trial. Patients      with PBC will be enrolled and randomly divided into two groups which will receive MSCs and      UDCA respectively. The investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of MSCs for PBC by      comparison of symptom improvement, survival rate and side effects in the two groups.    ",,"

Although bisphosphonates have      been found to reduce osteoporosis, clinical use for these drugs has been limited because of      its potential to produce serious side effects, such as mandibular osteonecrosis and atypical      femoral fractures. Therefore, new therapeutic strategies for osteoporosis are needed.      This study will assess the effectiveness of the allogeneic mesenchymal cell from umbilical      cord.

","      Study Design: Treatment, Randomized, Open Label, Parallel Assignment,Safety/Efficacy Study.      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells      (MSC) expanded ex-vivo infusion for the treatment of patients who have developed a newly      diagnosed extensive or refractory chronic graft versus host disease (chronic GVHD) to the      usual therapeutic measures.    ","      Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is one of the main limitations to successful      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and has a substantial impact not      only on survival but also on the quality of life of otherwise cancer-free patients. Half of      the patients undergoing a HLA-identical allografts who survive beyond 100 days may require      long-term immunosuppressive treatment for extensive chronic GVHD, often for more than 2      years. More than one-third of patients with chronic GVHD do not respond to first-line      therapy, which often involves combinations of corticosteroids and a calcineurin inhibitor.      There is no standard second-line or salvage therapy for these patients and they have a poor      outcome.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that can      differentiate into various lineages and have been used to repair injured tissues. Recently,      MSCs have also shown unique immunomodulatory properties ex-vivo, including inhibition of      T-cell proliferation after stimulation by allo-antigens and mitogens, and prevention of the      activity of cytotoxic T cells.MSCs have been used for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD and for      the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD,but rarely have been used for      extensive chronic GVHD.      Development of new therapeutic agents and strategies to rescue patients with extensive      chronic GVHD would provide a significant benefit in an area of unmet medical need.      In this study, a single center randomized, non blinded Phase II clinical trial is proposed to      study the safety and efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of extensive      chronic GVHD newly or refractory to the usual therapeutic measures.      Expanded MSC will be infused at a dose of 2 million cells/kg twice a week for 2 weeks and      weekly for the following two weeks (six doses totally)in patients based first-line therapy      (steroid plus cyclosporin A ) or their primary immunosuppressive therapies.

","      Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) is one kind of stem cell which is gained form adult tissue.      Although MSC derived from autogenic bone marrow are proven to help regeneration in non union      fracture and long bone defect, the aspiration process through iliac crest is invasive and      painful.      Therefore, alternative source of MSC which is less invasive is needed. Adipose and umbilical      cord is a ""waste product"" that proven to contain enormous MSC. Furthermore adipose and      umbilical cord as an allogenic source is more abundant in number compares to autogenic bone      marrow. This enormous source need and adequate preservation technique before applied to the      patient. According to that, researchers want to explore the potency of MSC from bone marrow,      umbilical cord and adipose as the source of allogenic MSC and the effect of cryopreservation      technique to the viability and quality of MSC. We will also compare the effectivity of MSC      implantation from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose applied to non union fracture and      long bone defect.      Samples from bone marrow, umbilical cord and adipose are cultured and the viability of the      cells are observed. Some of the cells are implanted directly to the patient with non union      fractures and long bone defect while some are cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen -190 degree      Celsius in three months. All samples are thawed and the viability of the cells are observed.      Patient who are implanted by MSC allogenic will undergo clinical and radiological examination      in the third, sixth and twenty second month after implantation.    ","      Research Methods Study Design This study is an experimental one arm study post test only.      Estimated Study Time Research estimated time would be 24 months, from May 2014 to May 2016.      Sample Gaining Procedure This research is a pilot study. Samples are obtained consecutively      from all source population that meet the criteria. The number of samples from each      mesenchymal stem cell ( adipose, bone marrow and umbilical cord) source are three. Each      samples derived from three different donors that met the inclusion criteria. For the      implanation, the subjects are five from each intervention. Yet regarding the limited funding      source and time, we will recruit one subject for each kind of MSC.      Subject Criteria Inclusion criteria for MSC donor      Bone marrow donor :      Male/female aged 19-30 year without any comorbiditites (Diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and      any other autoimmune disease), HIV test Hepatitis B test and Hepatitis C test are negaitve,      no fungal and bacterial contamination in the bone marrow. Subjects are willing to be      aspiratied in the iliac crest in order to get the bone marrow.      Adipose donor :      Adipose tissue are gained from liposuction or open reduction internal fixation procedure.      Samples of adipose are free from HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and free from fungal and      bacterial contamination.      Umbilical cord donor :      Umbilical cord are form elective seccio caecaria from a fullterm mother without any      complications and free from HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and no fungal and bacterial      contamination.      Recipient inclusion criteria Critical bone defect patients aged 6-55 who are willing to      undergo surgical intervention.      Recipient exclusion criteria Patients with pathological fracture caused by malignancy,      immunocompromised ( HIV AIDS, Diabetes mellitus, active Hepatitis), in a immunosuppresant      therapy ( chemotherapy or steroids).      Drop out criteria Patients are ruled out from this study if he/she stated to do so in the      time this research are held or she/he undergoes any other threatment that are not related to      this study. Patient who does not show any clinical improvement in three consecutive months is      categorized as failed to threat. All drop out and failed to threat patient could get other      threatment.      Informed Consent All subjects must fill and sign in the informed consent letters.      Research Protocol Mesenchymal stem cell taking method Bone Marrow taking Patient is lying      down in supine position, anesthetized locally. Aseptic and antiseptic are done in the illiac      crest location. Aspiration needle is inserted 450 to horizon in illiac crest. Hub is released      and a 10 cc syringe that contain heparin is connected to te needle. We aspirated about 50 cc      bone marrow from each subject.      Umbilical cord taking Right after the delivering the baby, the umbilical cord are cut and      kept in a sterile bowl containing 0.9% NaCl in 40 until the sample is proceed.      Adipose taking Adipose tissue are derived from liposuction or open reduction internal      fixation procedure. It is kept in a sterile bowl containing NaCL 0.9% in 40 C. Processing of      the sample is done within 8 hours after sample are taken.      Cryopreservation and re activation. All the samples are taken to culture laboratory in      integrated service of stem cell medical technology Cipto mangunkusumo hospita.this laboratory      is GMP (good manufacturing Product) certified. The samples ate cultured in appropriated      medium until it reach confluence and harvested. The cells then undergo caracterisation test      by flow cyto meter and viability and numbers are counted. Some of the cells then      cryopreserved while some are directly implanted into patient. The cells are cryopreserved for      three months and then reactivated. Viability and numbers then are measured. The cells then      are implanted to non union patient.      Specimen sterility Sterility tests are done three times to ensure there is no fungal and      bacterial contamination.      HA-CaSO4 and MSC For every centimeter of defect, 10 millions cells and 50 pellet HA-CaSO4 are      needed. The diluted MSC then mix with the HA-CaSO4 and incubated 5 minutes before implanted.      Intervention Surgical intervention is needed to assemble the fixation device in the long      bone. During the surgery, pellet HA-CaSO4 are inserted into the defect. After soft tissue are      closed the rest of the serum is injected into the defect area.      Observation and follow up Clinical and radiological follow up is done every 4 weeks.      Observation is done for 12 months or untill the bone unites. Every subject will be followed      up in the third, sixth, twelfth and twenty forth or until the fixation device is taken off.

","      Prevalence of osteoarthritis increases every year, as a chronic and progressive disease.      Osteoarthritis also gives many negative impacts in socio-economic life. Current management of      osteoarthritis only aimed to relieve pain but not to resolve the degeneration of cartilage.      Mesenchymal stem cell is one kind of adult stem cell that has potency in tissue engineering.      Sources of mesenchymal stem cell are bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord.      Researchers want to explore the potential of umbilical cord as the source of allogeneic MSC,      because the gaining process of MSC is not invasive. Some countries have started some In vitro      studies, Animal studies, and human research, but in Indonesia the study of mesenchymal stem      cell implantation from umbilical cord in genu osteoarthritis management has not been      reported. This study will be held into two years in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital and include 9      participants minimally. The researcher also compares the efficacy and safety of MSC      implantation from umbilical cord applied to genu osteoarthritis with synovial artificial and      recombinant human growth hormone therapy.    ","      This study is experimental clinical, randomized control trial. This study estimated time      would be 24 months, from May 2016 until May 2018. Samples are obtained consecutively from all      source population that meet criteria.

","      Hemophilia is caused by a single-gene defect resulting in familial bleeding disorder. Small      increase in gene products could transform a severe form of hemophilia into a mild one. Stem      cells from extrahepatic sources are being considered for clinical applications in liver cell      therapy as they possess high in vitro culture potential and could be used in transplant      procedures. We studied the differentiation of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs)      from hemophilia patients' relatives into factor 8 (FVIII)-producing hepatocyte-like cells      aiming to expand patients' donor options for partial replacement of mutant liver cells by      healthy cells in hemophilia A patients which could manage the severity of the bleeding      disorder.      BM-HSCs from hemophilic families will be cultured in short-liquid hepatic induction medium.      Appearance of hepatic phenotype will be evaluated by alpha-fetoprotein expression using      immunocytochemistry. Functional evaluation of transdifferentiation will be done through      detection of albumin synthesis using microalbumin assay kit, factor VIII activity by      one-stage clotting assay and expression of FVIII messenger RNA( mRNA) by reverse      transcription ( RT-PCR).      Inducing the differentiation of BM-HSCs by in-vitro manipulation may become a valuable tool      to provide a cell source for hepatocyte transplant procedures for treatment of hemophilia      patients.    ","      Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or abnormality of factor      VIII. It is the most common inherited coagulation protein deficiency with an incidence of      approximately 1 in 10,000 males. More than 75% of hemophilic patients suffer the severe type      of the disease.      Hemophilia treatments are readily available in developed countries; however, it is estimated      that 70% of people with this disease worldwide are undiagnosed or undertreated. Moreover,      about 20% of hemophilia A patients develop inhibitors to treatment and consequently are      difficult to treat.      Exogenous factor 8 replacement for hemophilia patients presents a great financial and medical      challenge. The optimum therapeutic option for these patients is to provide endogenous      secretion of the factor. This was proposed through liver transplantation. Liver      transplantation in human and canine hemophilia A results in an increase in factor VIII levels      to normal and thus cures the bleeding diathesis. Given the problems of donor availability,      major operative procedure and the need for lifelong immunosuppression, cell-based therapy      using isolated hepatocytes has been proposed as a promising option to treat clotting      disorders. The therapeutic effectiveness of human hepatocytes transplanted under the kidney      capsules of mice has been demonstrated. Transplantation of wild-type rats with deficient      bilirubin conjugation after ischemia/reperfusion damage resulted in 30% decrease in serum      bilirubin, the appearance of bilirubin conjugates in bile and the expression of normal      glucuronyltransferase enzyme denoting that transplantation of a small number of hepatocytes      can result in partial correction of functional defects.      Although cellular transplantation of hepatocytes solves the operative risk, it has the      disadvantage of difficult propagation of hepatocytes in vitro.      An alternative to hepatocyte transplantation is the use of in-vitro transdifferentiated bone      marrow derived stem cells.      In the past few years, a novel option to regenerate damaged liver from bone marrow-derived      cells has been proposed by many investigators. Studies showed that bone marrow cells not only      differentiated into hepatic and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells but they also expressed      the intact gene of the FVIII A3 domain.      Mesenchymal stem cells have many advantages as candidates for cellular therapy. They can be      propagated in-vitro, do not evoke immune reaction as they express only human leukocyte      antigen (HLA)-G, and have been proven to adopt hepatocyte phenotype in vitro.      In hemophilia A patients, the mother is a carrier, the father is completely normal, and the      female siblings have a 50% chance of being normal or carrier. Thus, the possibility of      finding an HLA-matched donor with normal FVIII activity in the family is present. The use of      mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) have the following advantaged over BM-HSCs:        1. MSCs can differentiate into both hepatic and endothelial phenotypes        2. MSCs do not express HLA antigens except HLA-G which caused immunosuppression, thus           matching for MSC transplantation can be easier.      The hypothesis of the present study is to use allogenic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem      cells induced to adopt hepatocyte phenotype in vitro as a cellular therapy product in      hemophilia patients.      Donors will be subjected to:        1. Bone marrow aspiration under local or short general anaesthesia, 40-60ml BM will be           collected on heparinized syringes.        2. Mononuclear cell fraction will be separated using SEPAX machine (Biosafe)        3. MSCs will be isolated using plastic adherence and subjected to hepatic induction using           sequential fibroblast growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor addition under GMP           conditions.        4. Verification of hepatic induction will be done using morphological, molecular and           proteomic screening.        5. Cells will then be harvested using 0.25% trypsin, washed and suspended in sterile saline           in a dose of 2 million cells per kg body weight in a final volume of 5ml and injected           into the hepatic parenchyma under sonographic monitoring.

","      Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading worldwide and has become a public health      emergency of major international concern. Currently, no specific drugs or vaccines are      available. For severe cases, it was found that aberrant pathogenic T cells and inflammatory      monocytes are rapidly activated and then producing a large number of cytokines and inducing      an inflammatory storm. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to possess a      comprehensive powerful immunomodulatory function. This study aims to investigate the safety      and efficacy of intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells in severe patients with      COVID-19.    ","      Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19), caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which occurs as a growing      pandemic in early 2020 and currently represents an emergency state worldwide. Several reports      have shown that the first step in the pathogenesis of Sars-Cov-2 is the recognition of the      angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor by the virus. This ACE2 receptor is widely      distributed on the surface of human cells, especially as type II alveolar cells and capillary      endothelium, however bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus and spleen are known as immune cells,      such as T and lymphocytes. B and macrophages, are negatives to ACE2. These results suggest      that immunotherapy can be used to treat infected patients. However, an immunomodulatory      capacity cannot be so strong, if just one or two major immunological factors used, as the      virus can cause a ""cytokine storm"", such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, GSCF, IP10 , MCP1, MIP1A and      TNFα, followed by edema, gas exchange dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome,      cardiac injury and secondary infection that can lead to death. Therefore, avoiding a      ""cytokine storm"" may be the key to treating patients infected with Sars-Cov-2. Mesenchymal      stem cells (MSCs), due to their potential for immunomodulatory activity, can have beneficial      effects in preventing or attenuating the cytokine storm. Because MSCs have been widely used      in cell therapy, from basic research to clinical trials. Safety and efficacy have been      clearly documented in several clinical trials, especially in immune-mediated inflammatory      diseases, such as graft versus host disease (GVHD). The objective of the study is to verify      the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in patients      with SARS-CoV-2.    ",,"

","      Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has become a health emergency around the world. Since first      patients were detected in Wuhan China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has spread quickly      worldwide, being a severe threat to public health. Fever, dry cough, shortness of breath and      breathing distress are the main characteristics of COVID-19 infection. Some patients develop      overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure, for which there is no specific      therapy. Therefore, safe and effective treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia is utterly necessary,      mainly in critical cases. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the      immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by      suppressing the proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. These      immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the phase I/II, placebo-      controlled, randomized MSCs for treatment of severe COVID-19 pneumonia.    ","      Novel coronavirus COVID-19 has spread quickly from Wuhan China to worldwide. On 15 April      2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has reported 1.914.916 confirmed cases and 123.010      deaths globally, being a severe threat to public health.      Some patients develop overwhelming lung inflammation and acute respiratory failure. Several      reports demonstrated that COVID-19 specifically recognized the angiotensin I converting ezyme      2 repector (ACE2) and ACE2-positive cells are infected by the virus. ACE2 receptor is widely      present on the human cells surface such as alveolar type II cells and capillary endothelium,      among others. COVID-19 infects cells and stimulates a terrible cytokine storm in the lung      followed by edema, dysfunction of the air exchange and acute respiratory distress which may      lead to death. Further, once COVID-19 enters in blood circulation, it can easy spread to some      systems and organs, causing significant damage. Under these circumstances, it is reasonable      to believe that the inhibition of inflammatory response is the key to treat COVID-19      pneumonia.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been widely used in the immune-mediated inflammatory      diseases. MSCs can regulate both innate and adaptive immunity by suppressing the      proliferation, differentiation and activation of different cells. Some studies have shown      that MSCs can significantly reduce acute lung injury in mice caused by H9N2 and H5N1 virus,      reducing proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cells into the lungs.      These immunomodulatory properties of MSCs support performance of the Phase I/II, double-blind      (neither the participant nor the investigator will know if active drug or placebo is      assigned), placebo-controlled, randomized (assigned by chance), in which subjects with severe      COVID-19 pneumonia shall be received either MSCs (1 million cells/kg) or placebo by      intravenous injection. The administration of cells will be done only once.    ",,"

","      Under controlled circumstances, and approved by European and Spanish laws, a      Compassionate-use Program allows the use of stem-cell therapy for patients with non-healing      diseases, mostly complex fistula-in-ano, who do not meet criteria to be included in a      clinical trial. Candidates had previously undergone multiple surgical interventions that had      failed. The intervention consisted of surgery (with closure of the internal opening or a      surgical flap performance), followed by stem cells injection. Three types of cells were used      for implant: stromal vascular fraction, autologous expanded adipose-derived or allogenic      adipose derived stem cells.      Healing was evaluated at 6th month follow-up. Outcome was classified as partial response or      healing. Relapse was evaluated 1 year later. Maximum follow up period was 48 months.    ",,"

","      In this study the investigators propose to perform a Phase II Clinical Trial which seeks to      evaluate the safety of cell therapy as a new treatment for patients who suffer from acute      non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). If it is successful, a later study      to assess efficacy will be performed.      This disease has an age-adjusted incidence rate of 10/100.000, and in many cases it results      in blindness. Currently, there is no available treatment and second eye involvement occurs in      approximately 15-25% of the cases.      All this background originates a particularly dramatic outcome for the patient. Therefore, it      seems justified to evaluate new therapies that maintain or improve the visual function in      these patients.      The Project includes a clinical trial whose purpose is the assessment of the safety of      intravitreal administration of allogenic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with NAION,      a product in clinical research phase (PEI No. 15-007) already approved for other human      clinical applications (PEI No. 15-007).      It can be considered that the therapy with intravitreal injection of MSC is a treatment      option in patients with acute NAION, since through the paracrine properties of these cells      (secretion of neurotrophic, immunomodulatory and anti-apoptotic factors) it may prevent or      reduce the progression of axonal degeneration caused by this disease.

","      Bone marrow MSCs will be isolated from allogenic donors, expanded under hypoxic conditions      using medium containing no serum or animal-derived reagents, and applies for Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study      in treating 18 recipients with ischemic limb diseases.    ","      Ischemic limb disease remains one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the      industrialized world despite the development of several new therapeutic modalities. Based on      experimental data demonstrating that infusion or injection of stem/progenitor cells enhances      blood flow in models of cardiovascular diseases, clinical trials were initiated in 2001 to      treat patients with critical limb ischemia or cardiac ischemia with circulating blood or bone      marrow-derived cells. Despite all promises, pending uncertainties and practical limitations      attenuate the therapeutic use of stem/progenitor cells for ischemic limb disease. The main      theme and method in the current program project, based on expertise, track record, and      preliminary results of PI's laboratory, is to focus on clinical studies of using allogenic      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), expanded under hypoxic conditions (1% O2), in treating      ischemic limbs. This project is an integrated and coordinated effort aimed to overcome the      regulation of cell product, and the barriers of preclinical and clinical studies. For the      purposes, we have specially set up the core laboratory for stem/progenitor cells production      and quality control in Cell Therapy Clean Room on the 9th floor of Medical Science Technology      Building in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. We have also completed the preclinical studies      in using allogenic hypoxic mouse MSCs in treating limb ischemia. In the current project, bone      marrow MSCs will be isolated from allogenic donors, expanded under hypoxic conditions using      medium containing no serum or animal-derived reagents, and applies for Phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study in      treating 18 recipients with ischemic limb diseases in three years.

","      Graft versus host disease is a serious and often life-threatening complication in allogeneic      haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Although corticosteroids are the first-choice of      treatment in these patients, but about 30-50% patients do not respond to it and develop      steroid-refractory GVHD. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have emerged as a promising treatment      option in these patients. This phase-I/II clinical trial aims at establishing the safety and      clinical efficacy of allogenic ex-vivo cultured MSCs to treat steroid-refractory GVHD in a      Pakistani HSCT cohort.    ","      Allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant has become first choice of treatment for many      malignant and non malignant haematological disorders. Although great progress has been made      to prevent and minimize transplant-associated complications, yet graft versus host disease      (GVHD) remains a significant complication affecting these the outcome in these patients. It      is a severe inflammatory condition that arises when recipient tissues are attacked by immune      mediated donor T cells during transplantation. Acute GVHD predominately affects the skin,      upper and lower GI tract, liver and occasionally the eye and oral mucosa, whereas chronic      GVHD resembles more with autoimmune disorders in its clinical symptoms. These symptoms can be      organ-specific or generalized throughout body.      The pathophysiology of GVHD shows that it has different phases. In first phase i.e., afferent      phase, damage to host tissue occurs. In second phase i.e., Induction and expansion phase,      donor T cells are triggered and activated by recipient and donor APC as well as the      inflammatory cytokines. Activated T cells produce IL-2 and IFN-γ (or Th1 response).      Allogeneic immune response is amplified by IL-2, which activates more T cells and natural      killer cell responses, triggering macrophages to release TNF-α and further inflammation      damages skin and gut. The third phase i.e., effector phase, is characterized by cytotoxic      damage against host cells by activated donor T-cell-mediated through Fas-Fas ligand      interaction, perforin-granzyme and TNF-α. The latter has a central role in the      pathophysiology, stimulating cytokine production (IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-α). This      dysregulation leads to the clinical manifestations of acute GVHD.      The cells involved in GVHD pathophysiology include CD4+ T cells; for maintaining the      expansion of CD8+ T cells that mediate GVHD, APCs; these have role in the initiation phase of      acute GVHD as described in murine models and Natural killer (NK) cells; contribute to tissue      damage in the effector phase by releasing inflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide. However,      natural killer cells mediate cell death by two important pathways: Fas-Fas-ligand-mediated      apoptosis and perforin-granzyme-B-mediated cytolysis.      HLA differences between donor and recipient are the major predictor of GVHD. Other affecting      factors include age, gender mismatch between donor and recipient, minor histocomapatability      antigen expression difference(mHA) in otherwise identical HSCT, donor age, source and dose of      stem cells (PBSCT greater risk than BM), intensity of conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis.      Steroids are the first line therapy for acute GVHD patients and are standard treatment for      grade II-IV acute GVHD. Adverse effects of glucocorticoids include hypertension hyperglycemia      and psychosis, immunosuppression, infections, myopathy, osteoporosis and avascular necrosis      of bone, cataracts and fat re-distribution etc. If acute GVHD is not improved after 5-7 days      treatment with steroids then it is considered as steroid-refractory. Various agents that are      being investigated from last two decades as second line therapy include low-dose MTX, MMF,      extracorporeal photopheresis, IL-2R targeting, antibody therapy against CD3, CD7, CD25, CD52,      CD147, IL-2R, IL-1, and TNF-α (i.e., basiliximab, daclizumab, denileukin, diftitox and      alemtuzumab), horse ATG, etanercept, infliximab, and sirolimus and recently infusions of      mesenchymal stem cells.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are defined as self-renewing, multipotent progenitor cells with      potential to differentiate into other cell types of mesodermal origin, such as adipocytes,      osteocytes, and chondrocytes. Mesenchymal and Tissue Stem Cell Committee of the International      Society for Cellular Therapy developed the minimal criteria for definition of MSCs which is      as follows: first, adherence to plastic; Second, positivity for the cell-surface molecules      CD105, CD73, and CD90 and negativity for CD45, CD34, CD14 or CD11b, CD79a or CD19, and human      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR; and third, the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts,      adipocytes, and chondroblasts under standard in vitro differentiation conditions. Since Le      Blanc and colleagues first reported successful treatment of a patient with severe acute GVHD      using third-party haploidentical MSCs in 2004, many clinical trials worldwide have described      the benefits of MSC therapy in GVHD.      The proposed project is a phase I/II clinical trial of single group, open label,      interventional study design. The objective is to observe the safety and efficacy of      intravenous injection of ex-vivo expanded bone marrow mesenchymal cells from a third party      donor for treating refractory GVHD. The study will also document the type and frequency of      any adverse event or side effects, if discovered.    ",,"

",      The overall objective of the investigators is to assess the therapeutic efficacy and      tolerability of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Derived Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)      isolated from hematogenous bone marrow for treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar      depression patient (TRBD).    ,"      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aiming to study      the efficacy and side effects of MSCs adjunctive to TAU compared to a normal saline solution      in patients with TRBD. Relevant patients with bipolar depression will be addressed in order      to establish whether they are willing to be screened for the study. The patients must be      assigned a patient number and sign the consent form after receiving oral and written      information about the study prior to undergoing any study procedures.      MSCs will be infused as a single dose up to one week after the inclusion of the patient. The      treatment trial lasts eight weeks. Of note, the investigators will assess patients also at      week 26 with a neurocognitive and clinical battery. It will not be allowed changes in      psychiatric medication during this period. If a patient or the treating clinician decides      that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave      the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to      take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications      for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical      conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians. The investigators      defined refractory bipolar depression as depression that failed to respond to two trials      (during lifetime) with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizer with proven efficacy in bipolar      depression (lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) in adequate doses for      at least 6 weeks or until cessation of treatment due to side effects (Schoeyen et al., 2015).      After the initial injection, patients will continue maintenance treatment with their current      psychiatrist. During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive      treatment as usual per their clinician's choice. Patients will remain on stable psychiatric      medications during this period. If patients need to change medications, they will be removed      from the study protocol.    ",,"

","Change in depression as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)baseline, week 8, week 26The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a short and reliable scale devised to be sensitive to change. Patients are rated on ten items, each of which has value ranges from 0 (the least pathology) to 6 (the most sever pathology). Sum scores range from 0 to 60, with a scoring of 20 indicating moderate and 30 severe depression. The scale is sensitive to change and covers many, but not all, symptom domains in depression.","
Change in Functional impairment as assessed by the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST)
baseline, week 26
The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) assesses functional impairment. FAST is a 24-item scale and assesses six functional domains: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive, financial issues, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Higher scores indicate higher degrees of functional impairment.

baseline, week 26
The Clinical Global Impression Scale for bipolar lllness (CGI-BP) is a modification of the CGI specifically for use in assessing global illness severity and change in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis. The clinician forms a global judgment both of the severity of the illness as compared to other cases with the same diagnosis and the global degree of change during treatment. There are 3 subscales (severity of mania, severity of depression, severity overall); and each subscale has a range of values from 1 (best) to 7 (worst).

Change in problem-solving ability as assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)
baseline, week 26
The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) assesses problem-solving ability and is thought to be an index of functioning of the prefrontal cortex. The task requires subjects to match cards to one of four target cards according to a certain sorting rule (color, shape or number) without explicit instructions regarding the nature of the sorting rule. After 10 consecutive matches, the sorting rule changes without warning, and the subject needs to determine the new principle. Perseverative errors and number of categories achieved will be used as dependent measures.

",      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of allogeneic adult      mesenchymal bone marrow cells administered intravenously to patients with ischemic stroke.    ,"      Stroke remains a major global healthcare problem. Recent data compiled by the American Heart      Association (AHA) for 2008 show that the annual incidence of new or recurrent stroke in the      United States is about 780,000, with approximately 600,000 of these strokes being first      attacks. Among adults age 20 and older, the estimated prevalence of stroke in 2005 was 5.8      million in the United States, resulting in >150,000 deaths annually, with 4.8 million stroke      survivors alive today. Stroke ranks as the country's third leading cause of death, behind      only cancer and heart disease. The only approved treatments of acute ischemic stroke involve      restoring blood flow to the affected region by using thrombolytics or mechanical devices that      physically remove clots. However, the use of thrombolytics is limited due to the therapeutic      window of < 3-6 hours post onset of stroke symptoms such that only a small fraction of stroke      patients receive this therapy. Following the completion of a stroke, there is little therapy      to offer patients to promote recovery other than physical, occupational, and speech therapy.      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different      indications demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell treatment. In      addition to their ability to differentiate into multiple different cell types that would be      contributory to the recovery and repair of the brain by replacing destroyed cells,      mesenchymal stem cells also secrete angiogenins, cytokines and trophic factors that can      support and stimulate multiple other cell types. The cascade of cellular events following the      release of these cytokines and trophic factors would also potentially lead to beneficial      effects by restoring blood supply, by rescuing cells at risk, and by stimulating the      remaining cell populations to repair and propagate new cells and synaptic connections.

",      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a one-time injection of allogeneic      mesenchymal bone marrow cells is safe and beneficial in the treatment of photodamage on the      face.    ,"      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from a number of sources, including bone      marrow, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood. The MSCs manufactured for this study are a      subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors.      These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can differentiate      into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to contributing directly to      repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate the body's own cells to      regenerate.      Though an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current      treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for      addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical      applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a      similar effect in skin rejuvenation.      In the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered      MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant cutaneous photodamage.    ",,"

",      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic bone      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat people with an ileal pouch anal      anastomosis (IPAA) who develop a fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch.    ,"      Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with      restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional      outcomes and quality of life. While less than 30% of patients experience short-term      postoperative morbidity following IPAA, up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to      technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the      pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations. Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is      notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local      repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a      devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.      Pelvic sepsis following original IPAA has been reported in 5% to 25% of patients, and is the      leading cause of pouch failure due to the development of pelvic fibrosis and decreased      distensibility of the pouch, ultimately resulting in poor pouch function. One of the leading      causes of pelvic sepsis and development of a pouch fistula is Crohn's Disease (CD) of the      pouch. While the majority of pouches are constructed for UC, up to 25% of patients with an      IPAA will end up having a change in diagnosis from UC to CD or development of de novo CD of      the pouch.      The first report of successful healing of a Crohn's fistula with mesenchymal stem cells      (MSCs) was in 2003. Since them great enthusiasm has spurred several phase I phase II, and      phase III trials designed to study the safety and efficacy of MSCs for perianal CD, all of      which have reported encouraging results with regard to safety and efficacy. With over 300      patients now treated, there is a large body of evidence supporting the local delivery of MSCs      to heal perianal Crohn's fistulas. Peri-pouch fistulas are similar to Crohn's perianal      fistulas except that instead of the rectum containing the internal opening of the fistula,      the internal opening is in the ileal pouch, constructed in place of the rectum.      Given the high safety profile and relative success in treating perianal Crohn's disease with      mesenchymal stem cells, the investigators are using a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow      derived MSC cell line to establish safety and secondarily monitor for healing in patients      with ileal pouch fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. This trial will use      allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce regenerative signals.      The specific rationale for MSCs in IPAA is based upon 1) their anti-inflammatory properties;      2) published experience of MSC in this condition and perianal Crohn's fistula demonstrating      efficacy and safety; 3) existence of cGMP methods for their isolation and growth.      This study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior      and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Patients who are      refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Patients enrolled will be      those that meet current indications.    ","

","      This study is being done to test if it is safe to give stem cells to adult patients with      Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The kind of stem cells we are studying are called allogeneic human      mesenchymal stem cells or MSCs. MSCs are cells in the body that can grow into different types      of cells and respond to various environmental situations. Allogeneic means the cells come      from another person (a donor).      This study is only looking at whether or not it is safe to give the stem cells to adults with      CF and how the infusion is tolerated. In the future, other studies may be done to see if stem      cells can be a new therapeutic treatment for CF.      Stem cells, like other medical products that are intended to treat, cure or prevent disease,      generally require approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can      be marketed. The FDA has not approved any stem cell-based products for usual medical care,      other than some specific blood forming stem cells for certain indications.    ","      This will be a prospective, single-center, dose-escalation, open-label interventional study      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic hMSCs in 15 clinically stable subjects      with CF age ≥ 18 years. After a two to six week screening period, subjects will have a      Baseline visit (Days 1-2) where they will undergo a single intravenous infusion of up to 5 x      10EE6 allogeneic hMSCs/kg of body weight. Infusions will be performed in the Dahms Clinical      Research Unit (DCRU) of University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. Subjects will be      monitored for any infusion related toxicities for 24 hours after the infusion. Subsequent      study visits will occur on Days 7, 14, 28, Months 3 and 6 and telephone calls will occur on      Days 4 (or 5), 21, 56 and Month 12. Subject safety and tolerability of a single dose of hMSCs      will be evaluated at study visits by review of subject diaries, interval history, pulmonary      exacerbations, physical examination, spirometry, and analysis of safety laboratories. Special      attention will be placed upon detecting pulmonary exacerbations because anti-inflammatory      therapies theoretically could suppress the immune system to the point where it leads to      increased infectious complications, although MSC therapeutics are proposed to be      antimicrobial. In addition to evaluating safety, this study will also explore efficacy      end-points for future clinical trials of MSCs in CF including inflammatory biomarkers from      blood and sputum. Serum markers (calprotectin, MPO, GM-CSF, IL-1β, IL-6, IL8, IL-17, and      TNF-a) and sputum markers (white cell counts and differentials, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10,      IL-17, GM-CSF, MIP- 3a, TNF-a, and active proteases including neutrophil elastase,      a1-anti-trypsin, and MMP-9) will be determined at Baseline and on Days 7 and 28 for with-in      subject comparison. All subject samples will be archived for future projects. Finally, a      diagnostic bone marrow exam will be performed on subjects with CF who consent to undergo this      optional procedure. Bone marrow samples will be banked and used for future translational      studies.    ",,"

","      The prevalence of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is reported to be between 3.4 - 4.9 cases per      100,000 population. The estimated average incidence is 0.6 - 0.7 cases per 100,000 people per      year. Many patients are not diagnosed properly during their lifetime because of the      difficulty in differentiating MSA from other disorders. Approximately 29 - 33% of patients      with isolated late onset cerebellar ataxia and 8 - 10% of patients with parkinsonism will      develop MSA.      There are currently no therapies that can cure or stop the progression of the disease. The      current pharmacological therapy is only to relieve symptoms. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are      considered an efficient source of cells for therapy, because they can be safely harvested and      transplanted to donors or patients, have low immunogenicity, and have broad therapeutic      potential. Results from preliminary preclinical and clinical trials indicate the potential of      MSC-based treatment in meeting several key aspects of neurodegeneration. Stem cell-based      therapy for neurodegenerative diseases aims to stop clinical damage by regenerating and by      providing local support for damaged tissue, in addition after transplantation, MSCs have been      shown to be capable of penetrating the lesion area and thus have great potential use as a      means of administering therapeutic agents.      The subjects of this study were patients who experienced possible MSA based on the consensus      clinical criteria for MSA. There will be three treatment groups with a total sample of 5      subjects each.      Group 1 will receives MSC-Adipose Autologous with doses 2x50 million cells intratechally.      Group 2 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x 50 million cells      intratechally.      Group 3 will receives MSC-Umbilical Cord Allogeneic with doses 2x50 million cells      intratechally and 2x10cc secretome MSC from Adipose Intravenously.      Clinical improvement will be evaluated using the UMSARS scale, PET-Scans, MRI, DaTScan,      IGF-1, BDNF, Sympathetic skin respons (SSR), EMG, Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS),      High definition-Optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT), ERG, VEP, Log MAR chart, Ishihara test      and side adverse effect on MSC.      This study is divided into six timeframes : Before an implantation, First Month after second      implantation, Third month after secondary implantation, Sixth month after second      implantation, Ninth month after second implantation and Twelve month after second      implantation. The differences between the test variables are then used as an indicator to      assess clinical improvement within the subjects.    ",,,"

Autologous Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Implantation
Before taking adipose tissue, each subject was screened including HbSAg, Anti HbS, Anti HCV, HIC, MCV and syphilis tests.
Adipose tissue was taken through 5 grams of subcutaneous fat biopsy from the abdomen of each subject and put into a transport medium and then sent to the RSCM-FKUI cGMP IPT Stem Cells Laboratory for immediate isolation of mesenchymal stem cells.
MSC that has been isolated will be cultured using the appropriate medium until it reaches the desired passage and the number of cells.
The viability and proliferation ability of cultured cells were evaluated, then characterization of cell antigen expression was carried out using flow cytometry to confirm the success of MSC culture.
The MSC to be injected into the subject will be prepared in 2cc physiological NaCl transport medium just before implantation.
The adipose secretion used is prepared in whole form as much as 10cc in a 10cc syringe.

",      This study will test whether selected allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs are safe by      assessing the composite end point Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection (BPAR)/ graft loss at 12      months.    ,"      Kidney transplantation has improved survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage      renal disease. However, despite advances in immunosuppressive therapy, long-term allograft      survival outcomes have not improved over the last decade.      A promising novel therapeutic immunosuppressive option in the treatment of renal recipients      with a profound effect on the fibrosis reaction is the clinical application of mesenchymal      stromal cells (MSCs). Allogeneic MSCs offer the advantage of availability for clinical use      without the delay required for expansion.      Although it is believed that allo MSCs are immune privileged, they could possibly elicit an      anti-donor immune response, which may increase the incidence of rejection/ graft loss and      impact the allograft survival on the long term. These safety issues should be studied before      further studies are planned with allogeneic MSCs in the transplant setting.      MSCs are infused at a time point when immune suppression is lowered and the kidney is at      increased risk for developing immune mediated injury. In addition, a large amount of the      kidneys already has signs of fibrosis at this time point and MSCs might reduce the fibrosis      which so importantly affects long term survival. MSCs will have no Human Leucocyte Antigen      (HLA) sharing with the mismatches of the donor and the recipient should have no antibodies      directed to the MSCs to reduce the anti-donor immune respons risk.

","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may be a therapeutic option in diseases associated with severe      inflammation or auto-immune diseases, due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory      properties.

Usually, the route of      administration of the cells in these studies is intravenous. Local injection of MSC for      fistulizing Crohn's Disease has proven efficacious. Endoscopy is a routinary technique for      the evaluation of gastrointestinal and colonic conditions.

","      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite      continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart      disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths.      Stem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus      helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a      variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form      myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The      underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the      cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be      irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular      components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing      on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation      into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy      on ventricular function and profusion.      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different      indications. These clinical trials showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias,      improvement in functional status and increased ejection fraction.      The hMSCs are able to:        1. Prevent reperfusion injury;        2. Prevent excessive fibrosis;        3. Reestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.        4. Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis;        5. Preserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration);        6. Prevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation. It is well           accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of           diagnosis;        7. Limit infarct size. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by           ejection fraction and LVESV preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject           quality of life as well as longevity.

",      This is a Phase I open label dose escalation trial of human allogeneic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for the treatment of septic shock. The main purpose of the      study is to assess the safety of MSCs in patients with septic shock.    ,"      Septic shock is one of the most common and devastating health problems in the intensive care      unit, with a mortality rate of approximately 40% and a staggering economic burden of      approximately 4 billion dollars annually in Canada. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may      provide a promising new treatment avenue, as pre-clinical research has shown that these cells      can modify a number of pathophysiological processes that are central to sepsis and greatly      reduce rates of organ failure and death. This dramatic effect appears to be due to the      ability of MSCs to modify the inflammatory cascade, augment tissue repair and enhance      pathogen clearance. MSCs have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials including those      with myocardial infarction, heart failure, neurological and metabolic disorders,      hematological malignancies, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with no serious safety      concerns. However, MSC therapy has not yet been evaluated in humans with septic shock. Prior      to a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of MSCs in septic shock, an      evaluation of safety is necessary. The Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial      is an open label Phase I dose escalation trial that will evaluate the safety of MSC therapy      in this vulnerable population.    ",,"

",      Thirty (30) patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI      scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization will be enrolled in the study. This is a phase      II study intended to gain additional safety and efficacy assessments among two dose levels      previously studied in a phase I setting.    ,"      Thirty (30) patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction secondary to MI      scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization will be enrolled in the study.This is a phase II      study intended to gain additional safety and efficacy assessments among two dose levels      previously studied in a phase I setting. In this study, a 20 million total hMSC dose and a      100 million total hMSC dose will be randomly allocated administered via the Biocardia Helical      infusion system in a blinded manner.      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed      cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily      available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to      survive in host myocardium, which is often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered      cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the      surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this      may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft      cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a      number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and      neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile      grafts9, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac      precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development      in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both      post-infarction patients and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and      heart failure. The effects of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also      been studied clinically.      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent a highly promising modality for      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority      of the trials.      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction is a common and problematic condition;      definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority      of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied      less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.    ",,"

Secondary objective: Assessment of efficacy at baseline, prior to discharge, 1 month, 3      months, 6 months and 12 months after treatment based on the following: EDSS and 29-item      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consisting of (1)      Timed 25-Foot Walk, (2) 9 Hole Peg Test, and (3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and      gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)    ","      STUDY TREATMENT:      Investigational therapy product: Wharton Jelly derived allogeneic MSCs.      Method of administration and dose: Super selective intravenous administration of 50 million      Allogeneic Human Umbilical Cord Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) and      intrathecal administration of UC-MSCs in dose of 100 million along with liberation therapy      (when associated with CCSVI).      SAFETY AND EFFICACY EVALUATION:      The proposed study will assess safety and primary and secondary efficacy endpoints after      super selective intravenous and intrathecal administration of allogeneic umbilical cord      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) in 69 patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.      Safety Evaluation:      Assessment of treatment safety based on incidence of any treatment emergent/treatment      associated adverse events prior to discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment.      Efficacy evaluation:      Clinical evaluations, including EDSS and 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)      will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization, prior to discharge at 1, 3, 6      and 12 months after stem cell therapy.      The MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consists of the (a) Timed 25-Foot Walk, (b) 9 Hole Peg      Test, and (c) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test will be performed at baseline before stem      cell mobilization and at 12 months after stem cell therapy.      Gadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain will be performed at baseline before therapy and      then 12 months after stem cell therapy. Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of      scanner used at baseline. Scans will be analyzed centrally. The 'baseline MRI scan' will be      the reference for brain volume changes.      DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:      Descriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed. Proportion of adverse events at      each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution. The frequency, severity, timing      and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize      the safety of the intervention.      The probability of overall event-free survival (as well as progression-free, relapse-free, or      MRI event-free survival) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated. The end point of      progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater      than 0.5 from baseline. Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with      Wald-type 90% CIs based on Greenwood's formula for SE.      Descriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using      descriptive statistics. Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this      efficacy measurement scales (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg      Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions,      new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion.      The percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by      end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the      results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in      brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of      those who have not met the end point by month 12.      Other primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test,      MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) will be analyzed using a      Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be      calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value      minus the baseline value. The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from      baseline measurement in the values at the month 1, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits was      significantly different from zero,with baseline measurement defined as the screening      assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other      end points.      To calculate MSFC, results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score      and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint. The z scores that      compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National      Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database.    ",,"

Secondary objective: Assessment of efficacy at baseline, prior to discharge, 1 month, 3      months, 6 months and 12 months after treatment based on the following: EDSS and 29-item      Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consisting of (1)      Timed 25-Foot Walk, (2) 9 Hole Peg Test, and (3) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test and      gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)    ","      STUDY TREATMENT:      Investigational therapy product: Wharton Jelly derived allogeneic MSCs.      Method of administration and dose: Super selective intravenous administration of 50 million      Allogeneic Human Umbilical Cord Tissue-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSC) and      intrathecal administration of UC-MSCs in dose of 100 million along with liberation therapy      (when associated with CCSVI).      SAFETY AND EFFICACY EVALUATION:      The proposed study will assess safety and primary and secondary efficacy endpoints after      super selective intravenous and intrathecal administration of allogeneic umbilical cord      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) in 69 patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis.      Safety Evaluation:      Assessment of treatment safety based on incidence of any treatment emergent/treatment      associated adverse events prior to discharge and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months post treatment.      Efficacy evaluation:      Clinical evaluations, including EDSS and 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29)      will be performed at baseline before stem cell mobilization, prior to discharge at 1, 3, 6      and 12 months after stem cell therapy.      The MS Functional Composite (MSFC) consists of the (a) Timed 25-Foot Walk, (b) 9 Hole Peg      Test, and (c) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test will be performed at baseline before stem      cell mobilization and at 12 months after stem cell therapy.      Gadolinium enhanced MRI scans of the brain will be performed at baseline before therapy and      then 12 months after stem cell therapy. Follow-up scans will be performed on the same type of      scanner used at baseline. Scans will be analyzed centrally. The 'baseline MRI scan' will be      the reference for brain volume changes.      DATA COLLECTION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:      Descriptive analyses of the adverse events will be performed. Proportion of adverse events at      each visit will be calculated using frequency distribution. The frequency, severity, timing      and the potential relationship to the intervention will be assessed in order to characterize      the safety of the intervention.      The probability of overall event-free survival (as well as progression-free, relapse-free, or      MRI event-free survival) at baseline through 1 year will be calculated. The end point of      progression is defined as increased Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score greater      than 0.5 from baseline. Analyses will be conducted using Kaplan-Meier estimates with      Wald-type 90% CIs based on Greenwood's formula for SE.      Descriptive analyses of all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed using      descriptive statistics. Proportion of patients with clinically significant change in this      efficacy measurement scales (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test, MSFC-Nine Hole Peg      Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) and change in gadolinium enhancing lesions,      new T2 lesions from previous visit will be presented as a proportion.      The percentage of change in brain volume will be calculated from screening and analyzed by      end point status at month 12 with an exact Wilcoxon rank sum test using mean scores when the      results are identical.The null hypothesis tests whether the median percentage of change in      brain volume among participants who met the endpoint by month 12 is equal to the median of      those who have not met the end point by month 12.      Other primary and secondary efficacy endpoints (EDSS, MSIS, MSFC, MSFC-25 foot walking test,      MSFC-Nine Hole Peg Test, MSFC-Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test) will be analyzed using a      Wilcoxon signed rank test. Change from baseline outcomes for all the endpoints will be      calculated for each patient who underwent stem cell transplant as the post transplant value      minus the baseline value. The null hypothesis tests whether the median difference from      baseline measurement in the values at the month 1, month 3, month 6 and month 12 visits was      significantly different from zero,with baseline measurement defined as the screening      assessment for the percentage of change in brain volume and the baseline visit for all other      end points.      To calculate MSFC, results from each of the 3 components will be transformed into a z score      and averaged to yield a composite for each patient at each timepoint. The z scores that      compose the MSFC score will be calculated using the reference population from the National      Multiple Sclerosis Society Task Force database.    ","

","      The disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus is a viral disease that infects the lungs,      producing flu-like symptoms. Elderly infected patients and/or those with co-morbidities may      suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome due to pneumonia (COVID-19 disease). Given      the high transmission, this virus has spread in recent months from Wuhan (China) to the whole      world, becoming a global emergency pandemic. The lack of curative treatment for this disease      justifies the need to carry out clinical trials that provide quality evidence on treatment      options. Given the pathophysiology of the disease, which involves an uncontrolled      inflammatory response of alveolar cells, a treatment that attenuates the cytokine cascade      could be key in rescuing the patient's lung tissue. Mesenchymal cells, due to their      immunoregulatory potential and regenerative capacity, can be an effective treatment for      patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.      In the present study we propose a therapy with undifferentiated allogeneic mesenchymal cells      derived from umbilical cord tissue, a treatment whose safety has already been described in      other clinical trials and that shows promising results in pilot studies carried out in China.

","      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a rare (prevalence: 40- 50/100 000 persons)      heterogeneous auto-immune and auto-inflammatory disease (AD), affecting both sexes and all      races, with a peak incidence / prevalence among black people and a predilection for women in      the 3rd-4th decade of life. SLE is characterized by successive periods of flares and      remission, which may all vary in duration and quality. Prognosis of severe forms of SLE,      which affect lung, heart or brain in addition to renal involvement, has improved, but still      evolution remains pejorative in a subset of patients whose 10 years mortality remains 10-15%,      even in tertiary referral centers. For 20 years, no new prospective clinical trial in the      course of SLE has demonstrated its effectiveness. New biological therapies have not yet made      the long awaited breakthrough in the treatment of severe SLE and only anti-Blys monoclonal      antibody has gained indication in moderately active SLE. In addition, serious adverse side      effects (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) observed with several biologics in AD      patients has dampened their expected benefits. For SLE subjects resistant to 1er or 2nd line      conventional treatment, there is a need to develop more effective therapies with fewer long      term side effects, based on new immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive strategies.      According to their in vitro immunomodulatory properties and ability to induce tissue repair      mechanisms, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been proposed as a new therapy for several AD,      including SLE. The use of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived MSC is based on experimental and      human clinical data, particularly produced by Nanjing team (Pr Sun) in China. It is also      logical to select SLE patients with the same severity criteria as those used worldwide to      validate the efficacy of anti-Blys therapies. Similarly, the analysis of the expected results      should take into account criteria similar or comparable to those used for the pivotal      clinical trials. This trial is a unique opportunity to set up collaboration between      Saint-Louis APHP, clinical expert center for cell therapy in AD, and University College      London for cell manufacturing.

","      Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetically inherited disorder of copper      metabolism, causing neurological, psychiatric and liver disease. The ATP7B gene on the 13th      chromosome is responsible for the disease. Liver has a critical role on copper metabolism. It      is the main site of copper accumulation and bile secretion is the only physiologic way of      copper elimination. Due to defective production of ceruloplasmin which carries copper, wide      amount of free copper precipitates throughout the body but particularly in the liver, eyes      and brain. Patients are bound to lifelong chelating agents such as penicillamine, trientine      and tetramine dihydrochloride. Unfortunately, these medications may cause severe side-effects      such as hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, auto-immune disease and      sideroblastic anemia. Medical treatment of liver cirrhosis, the last stage of the illness      that leads to morbidity and mortality in the Wilson Disease, is difficult. Liver      transplantation is still the most effective treatment for the patients with liver cirrhosis      in Wilson Disease. However, serious problems are accompanied with liver transplantation. Lack      of liver donors, complications during and after the surgery, graft rejection and high costs      are the main problems.      There are cells in the human body that are capable to renew themselves and differentiate to a      diverse range of specialized cell types. These are called ""stem cells"". Stem cells can be      differentiated to specialized cells in appropriate medias in the laboratory. Recently, the      differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells into hepatocytes is proved by      demonstrating hepatocytes containing Y chromosome in the female who has had bone marrow      transplantation from male donors. In many laboratory studies, it is observed that human bone      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, transplanted to animals with induced liver damage,      differentiate into the albumin producing hepatocytes without fusion. By these studies, it is      understood that mesenchymal stem cells are more potent than other bone marrow elements in      context of differentiation to hepatocytes. Even though the number of studies on human for the      same purpose is few, findings are supporting those of animal experiments. Mesenchymal stem      cells are non-immunogenic. Safety and feasibility of allogeneic transplantations between      individuals without need of immunosuppressive drug regimen are proven. Proofs of correcting      metabolic defects by this way are also presented in some publications. For the reasons      mentioned above, allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation is a promising treatment      modality especially for the hereditary metabolic diseases. By this way, non-immunogeneic      mesenchymal stem cells which have healthy genetic structure, can manufacture the required      enzyme, will be repopulated in the damaged tissue and contribute to the clinical improvement.      In this study, mesenchymal stem cells will be derived from healthy volunteer donor's bone      marrow and be expanded in-vitro, and then 1 million cells per kg will be infused to patients      with liver cirrhosis related to Wilson disease, 50 million cells via hepatic artery and the      remaining cells via peripheral vein. It is aimed to enable liver regeneration, decrease      fibrosis rate, improve patient's health conditions, increase ceruloplasmin synthesis,      ameliorate disorder of copper metabolism, decrease the need for chelating agents, increase      living standards of patients, and prolong waiting time for liver transplantation. Finally it      is aimed to establish a new and regenerative treatment protocol alternative to liver      transplantation. For observation of clinical and laboratory improvement, patients are planned      to be monitored by histopathologic examination of liver biopsies before and at 6th month      after the treatment, monthly biochemical and hematologic blood tests and periodic radiologic      examinations. This is a hopeful, avant garde and sophisticated study which may constitute new      horizons in context of cellular therapies.    ",,,"

","      Randomized, multicentric, prospective, double-blind study: effectiveness of adding allogenic      stem cells to a platelet-poor plasma scaffold after arthroscopic debridement and      microfractures in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus Osteochondral lesions of      the talus (LOC), affects the ankle cartilage, which it seems to have less repair capacity      than that of other joints such as the knee of the hip. The LOC can be an important source of      pain and affects comparatively younger, working age and athletically active patients.      Although there are several therapeutic strategies, debridement and microfractures performed      arthroscopically are the most frequent procedures. After this surgery, it is expected that      fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Though good results have been      reported, this fibrocartilage presents histological characteristics of lower quality to those      of the native articular cartilage.      Based on previous studies in different joints, it is hypothesized that the augmentation      treatment of osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal allogeneic stromal cells      derived from the umbilical cord produces better clinical and imaging results than standard      treatment with debridement and microfractures only.      Therefore, the present study seeks to compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement      and microfracture treatment versus adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in      allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells derived from the umbilical cord in patients with      osteochondral lesions of the talus.    ","      As with other major joints of the lower limb that carry weight (hip, knee), the osteochondral      lesion (LOC) of the talus, can be a major source of pain and disability for the affected      patient. The LOC of the talus can appear after one (or repeated) traumatic injury,      compromises the bone and adjacent cartilage, being able to cause blisters in the cartilage      layers, lesions similar to a cyst within the bone under the cartilage, or fracture of the      cartilage and the bony layers.      The ankle joint supports multiple loads of the corporal weight in the daily activities, the      reason why the properties of the cartilage in the ankle are different from those that appear      in the hip and the knee. In the absence of an injury, the cartilage of the ankle has better      resistance and tension properties to face the increase of forces than the hip or knee      throughout life.      However, once an injury appears, the cartilage of the ankle appears to have less repair      capacity compared to the hip or knee. Since the most common cause of LOC of the talus is      post-traumatic, the average age of these patients is comparatively lower than that of      patients affected by injuries to other joints.      Osteochondral injuries have an incidence of 27 per 10,0000 inhabitants in the USA. They are      injuries that usually affect the working population and active sportsperson, producing pain,      functional limitation and that probably contribute towards the evolution of an accelerated      joint degeneration. Currently, there are multiple treatment modalities used by ankle and foot      surgeons. These include debridement and microfractures of the subchondral plaque, utilization      of totipotential cells, osteochondral autograft/allograft, tibiotalar arthrodesis, and      partial/total ankle arthroplasty. However, no treatment offers a clear superiority over the      others.      Debridement and microfractures performed arthroscopically is the most frequently used      procedure and involves; the removal of degenerated cartilage and subchondral bone; obtaining      firm lesional edges that prevent the spread of the lesion; and finally the stimulation of the      bone marrow talar by performing microfractures of the subchondral plate. This with the hope      that fibrocartilage will form that covers the osteochondral lesion. Although this      fibrocartilage has histological characteristics different from those of native articular      cartilage, good results have been reported in 82% of the cases when combining good quality      studies in this regard.      The standard technique is not able to generate a replacement articular cartilage strong      enough to support the joint loads to which the ankle is exposed. Therefore, clinical trials      seek to increase the traditional treatment of debridement and microfractures with the      intra-articular use of totipotent cells at the end of the procedure. Although the results of      these series are promising and comparable at least to those of traditional treatment, the      absence of comparative studies between them complicates the choice of treatment for both the      patient and the surgeon. For this reason, the investigators have designed a prospective,      comparative, double-blind study that will allow elucidating which of these interventions is      the best alternative for our patients.      General Objective:      To compare the effectiveness of traditional debridement and microfracture treatment versus      adding a platelet-poor plasma (PPP) scaffold embedded in allogenic stromal mesenchymal cells      derived from the umbilical cord in patients with osteochondral lesions of the talus.      Specific Objectives:        -  To compare functional and radiological results before versus post-surgery within each           group studied (control and experimental)        -  To compare functional results after surgery of the groups in traditional treatment           versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).        -  To compare the quality of repair of the tissues of the groups in traditional treatment           versus traditional treatment plus mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).      Work hypothesis:      The augmentation treatment of the osteochondral lesions of the talus with mesenchymal cells      produces better clinical and imaging results than standard treatment with only debridement      and microfractures.

Baseline
MRS allows noninvasive detection and measurement of normal and abnormal metabolites and biochemical changes in the brain . The frequency of different metabolites is measured in units called parts per million (PPM) and plotted on a graph as peaks of varying height . The metabolites normally detected in the brain, regardless of the adopted echo time, include Nacetyl aspartate (NAA),a neuronal marker, choline (Cho), a membrane marker, and creatine (Cr), an energy metabolism marker. Increase in NAA /Cr and NAA/Cho ratios expected as baseline and would be expected to have a change after Stem Cell therapy in favor of neuroglia cells load or number increase at the site of previous brain damage.

Change in motor function as assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Total score
baseline, 3 weeks
The UPDRS serves as a disability and impairment scale for progression follow-up and is divided into four sections.
Part I: evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood (13 questions).
Part II: evaluation of activities of daily living including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food (13 questions).
Part III: motor examination (33 scores based on 18 questions with right, left or other body distributions scores)
Part IV: motor complications (6 questions)
All items have 5 response options with uniform anchors of: 0 = normal, 1 = slight (symptoms/signs with sufficiently low frequency or intensity to cause no impact on function), 2 = mild (symptoms/signs of frequency or intensity sufficient to cause a modest impact on function, 3 = moderate (symptoms/signs sufficiently frequent or intense to impact considerably, but not prevent function), 4 = severe (symptoms/signs that prevent function).

baseline
A set of diffusion-weighted image volumes (32-directions, high angular resolution) will be collected using the gradient overplus option with one B0 (non-diffusion weighted) image volume acquired before the acquisition of one repetition of the diffusion-weighted scans. Diffusion tensor and associated computations will be performed. White matter microstructure will be examined, which represents the structural pathways linking specific cortical and subcortical regions. It will be determined whether there is increased fractional anisotropy and decreased mean diffusivity along white matter fibers that link regions exhibiting increased functional connectivity, such as substantia nigra and dorsal striatum.

Safety test of allogenic ASCs injection             2. Efficacy test of allogenic ASCs injection    ,"      -  Background: Fecal incontinence is a distressing condition with recurrent uncontrolled           passage of fecal material. Although fecal incontinence is developed by multifactorial           causes, treatments were limited in medical or surgical methods. According to the recent           studies of stem cell regeneration, it is reported that human adipose-derived stem cells           have plentiful capacity in muscle regeneration, which had the efficacy to treat Crohn's           fistulas. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that the capability of muscle           regeneration of allogenic-adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ALLO-ASC) can be used           to treat degenerated anal sphincter, which leads to fecal incontinence.        -  Purpose:The investigators aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy in the treatment           of fecal incontinence by injection of ALLO-ASC into the anal sphincter.        -  Method             1. Safety test of allogenic ASCs injection In the first year, the investigators will                investigate the safety of ALLO-ASC injection by a dose escalation study. Patients                are sequentially enrolled into three groups, which are composed of three patients                each. They are treated with an injection of ALLO-ASC to the anal sphincter for                3x107 cells/ml (group 1), 6x107 cells/ml (group 2), 9x107 cells/ml (group 3),                respectively. After receiving the ALLO-ASC injection, patients will receive a                physical examination, a serologic and immunologic response test (CD4/CD8) with an                assessment of the Wexner score, patient satisfaction survey, WHO toxicity scale,                adverse events, anorectal manometry and endorectal ultrasound at 1, 4, 8 weeks, 4,                6, 9, and 12 months in the outpatient clinic. The response of ALLO-ASC injection is                assessed at 8 weeks after an injection and the most effective dose is determined                among the groups.             2. Efficacy test of allogenic ASCs injection In the second year, the investigators                will assess the efficacy of the ALLO-ASC injection comparing the ALLO-ASC injection                group and the placebo group (0.9% normal saline injection) by a randomized,                open-label, single-blind design.

","      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of treating patients experiencing poor      graft function after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with ex-vivo-expanded      BM-drived mesenchymal stem cells from third-party donors. Our first objective was to evaluate      the effect of such treatment on poor graft function, and second object was to investigate the      safety of such treatment.    ","      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) can cure many hematologic      diseases. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side      effects associated with transplantation, poor graft function (PGF) remains an important      complication that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable morbidity      and mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually      involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or repeat transplantation, but these methods are      associated with short-term effect and a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease（GVHD）      development, respectively.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and      treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of      treatment of PGF that develops after allo-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a      third-party donor is rarely reported. If such treatment could be shown to be effective and      safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would      have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly,      and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with PGF      after allo-HSCT.

",      The purpose of conducting phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of allogenic      bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells(CS20AT04) in subjects with lupus nephritis.      Evaluating DLT by IV injection according to dose-escalating in lupus nephritis patients.    ,"      Lupus is a representative autoimmune disease that affects the whole body. It is occurred by      generation of autoantibody and immune complex due to abnormal activation of the immune cells      on the basis of abnormal immune responses.      Although about 50% of lupus patients have lupus nephritis, there is no therapy product      targeted for the lupus nephritis now.      We have performed the pre-clinical and clinical studies using allogenic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells in SLE.      CS20AT04 has anti-inflammatory effects, controls activity of immune cells and reduces      generation of autoantibodies. So, it is expected to have treatment effects of lupus      nephritis.      The clinical trial was designed as a single center, open-label, phase 1 clinical trials.      If that subject's written informed consent form to participate in this clinical trial will be      conducted the required examinations and tests in accordance with the study protocol within 56      days investigational drug administration.

The ultimate therapeutic goal in such cases is cardiac transplantation      which is restricted by donor availability. Alternatively, left ventricular assist devices      (LVAD) are increasingly used as bridge to transplantation or more recently as destination      therapy in non-transplant candidates. Widely used second- and third-generation      continuous-flow LVAD offer symptomatic relief and prolong life. However, LV unloading rarely      improves native heart function in ischemic hearts. We aim to increase myocardial viability      and improve native cardiac function in patients with end-stage ICM by injecting allogeneic      bone marrow stem cells at the time of LVAD implantation.

",      This study plans to enroll 10 patients aged 13-17 years of age with refractory perianal      fistulizing disease. Patients will be treated by direct injection to the fistula tract(s)      with 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again      after 3 months if not completely healed.    ,"      Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal      tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based      studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two      decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These      patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent      perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and      impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more      aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of      children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of      pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children      with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.      This study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal      fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue      flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.      Patients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed.

",      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of human allogeneic      mesenchymal bone marrow cells (aMBMC) administered intravenously to subjects with ST Segment      Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).    ,"      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality despite      continuing advances in various treatment options. In developed countries, ischemic heart      disease causes more than 50% of all cardiovascular deaths. It is estimated that one in three      or approximately 80 million American adults have one or more types of CVD, with approximately      38.1 million of those estimated to be 60 years of age or older. The data was extrapolated to      the United States population in 2006 from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey      (NHANES) 2005-2006 data.      Mortality data show CVD as the underlying cause of death (including congenital cardiovascular      defects) accounting for 35.3% (864,480) of all 2,448,017 deaths in 2005, or one of every 2.8      deaths in the United States. CVD total deaths (1,372,000 deaths in 2005) accounted for about      56% of all deaths in 2005. Nearly 2,400 Americans die of CVD each day, an average of one      death every 30 seconds. CVD claims about as many lives each year as cancer, chronic lower      respiratory diseases, accidents, and diabetes mellitus combined (NCHS).      Stem cell transplantation has the potential to repair and improve cardiac function, thus      helping to significantly decrease morbidity and mortality rates. Preclinical data from a      variety of animal studies demonstrated the capacity for skeletal myoblasts to engraft, form      myotubules, and enhance cardiac function after transplantation into infarcted myocardium. The      underlying sequela of the post infarcted left ventricle often includes massive damage to the      cardiomyocyte. The left ventricle remodeling (dilation) and dysfunction is thought to be      irreversible. The development of treatments that will regenerate its musculature and vascular      components is now considered a main therapeutic challenge. Preliminary human studies focusing      on subjects with ischemic heart disease have demonstrated successful myoblast transplantation      into the post infarction scar. Another study demonstrated the benefits of stem cell therapy      on ventricular function and profusion. Dib et. al., demonstrated the survival, feasibility,      and safety of autologous myoblast transplantation and suggests that stem cell transplantation      offers a potential therapeutic treatment for end-stage heart disease.      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in a number of clinical trials for different      indications. These clinical trials demonstrated the safety of allogeneic mesenchymal stem      cell treatment. Allogenic mesenchymal bone marrow cells can be isolated from bone marrow.      They are the primary cells used in tissue engineering expressing multiple cell types. Tissue      engineering is very promising, generating hope that reconstruction of organs and repair      diseased and damaged tissue may be possible.      There are two major types of aMBMC, hematopoetic (mononuclear) and stromal MSCs. Stromal      MBMC, the cell type to be used in this study, proved to be more effective in reestablishing      profusion as they secreted additional cytokine factors associated with angiogenesis. The      multilineage potential of stromal MSCs, their ability to elude detection by the host immune      system and even down regulate T-cell response allows for allogeneic multiple stem cell      therapeutic use.      Occlusion of the left main or left anterior descending artery causes irreversible injury to      the cardiomyocytes in as little as 20 minutes. The goal of therapy in ischemic cardiomyopathy      is to limit damage in the following areas:        -  Limit infarct size        -  Prevent reperfusion injury        -  Prevent excessive fibrosis        -  Reestablish function of hibernating cardiomyocytes in peripheral zone area.        -  Reestablish angiogenesis/vasculogenesis        -  Preserve wall motion (prevent arrhythmia and functional contractile deterioration)        -  Prevent post infarct ventricular remodeling and left ventricular dilation It is well           accepted that dilated cardiomyopathy mortality rates are 50% within 5 years of           diagnosis. If we can preserve and restore cardiac function as measured by ejection           fraction, preserving left ventricular integrity would increase subject quality of life           as well as longevity.      An IV study administering adult allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to 53 subjects      following AMI showed excellent safety, reduction in arrhythmias, improvement in functional      status and increased ejection fraction. The availability of ""off the shelf"" allogeneic stem      cells will allow for an easily adjustable dose (getting enough cells in the autologous model      is often a problem) for each individual subject. The ease of IV administration will make stem      cell therapy more cost effective and safer to administer than the current catheter models.      This study protocol will expand on the safety and efficacy of aMBMC in subjects suffering      from ischemic cardiomyopathy.    ","

","      Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disease of motor neurons. In the      early 1980s, Werdnig from Vienna University and Hoffman from Heidelberg University described      this disorder. So SMA type 1 was named Werdnig- Hoffman disease. This is the first genetic      disorder that cause death after cystic fibrosis in infants with the prevalence of 1 in 6000      birth. Mutation in the SMN1 gene (Survival Motor Neuron) is the reason for the disease that      cause decrease in the SMN protein production. So the alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord      ventricle horn will be destroyed and it cause progressive paralysis and defenite death.No      specific therapy is yet available for the treatment of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease. Treatment is      not disease-modifying and just is supportive. SMA type 1 is diagnosed within the early 6      month after birth and accompanied with breath disorders and definite death in 2 years. The      affected infants have a weak muscle tone and they couldn't even hold their head up. Perhaps      the only open way for these patients is the application of stem cells that could deliver      trophic factor to the apoptotic cells. So this study focuses on the effectivness of cell      therapy via adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells on the probable phenotypic changes in      these patients.    ",,,"

","      This is an open-label, one-arm single-center phase Ⅱa study exploring the efficacy and safety      of CS20AT04 (HLA-haplo Matched Allogenic Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells) in two subpopulation      group of systemic lupus erythematosus patients - lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.    ","      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that      can affect virtually every organ. A subset of SLE patients continues to suffer significant      morbidity and mortality from active disease, with visceral organ involvement. Therefore, it      is urgent to develop a more effective therapy for SLE disorder, especially for      treatment-refractory patients.      Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are known to be effective in modulating immune      cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and Neutral Killer (NK) cells      and treating acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Also, based on the anti-inflammatory and      immunomodulatory properties, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been widely      studied as a candidate for the treatment of refractory immune- and inflammation-mediated      disease, and have extensive experience of use.      Half-matched allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the active ingredient of      CS20AT04 Injection, not only have the potential to differentiate into various mesenchymal      cells but also have various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and thus are      expected to induce and maintain remission of lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.      This study is designed to investigate the following. Subjects enrolled into the CS20AT04 with      corticosteroid taper regimen arm will receive two infusions of CS20AT04(2.0×10^6cell/kg), on      0 day and on 12 weeks post-enrollment. Subjects will return for efficacy and safety      assessments on 3 days, 1 week, and every 4 weeks each post-infusion until Week 24. Safety      monitoring will be continued at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years post-infusion.    ",,"

",      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and chronic lung disease that occurs in preterm      infants following ventilator and oxygen therapy and is associated with long-term health      consequences. Preclinical research shows that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modify a      number of pathophysiological processes that are central to the progression of BPD and thus      present as a promising new treatment option. The main purpose of this Phase I study is to      evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs in extremely preterm infants      at risk of developing BPD.    ,"      Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under      the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows      ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication      of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment.      Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes      it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a      major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new      treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while      promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all      preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for      the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of      extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term      hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs      (uc-MSC).      The aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of      intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This      will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design.    ",,"

","      This study is a first-in-human assessment of safety of using UCMSC in patients with AMI via a      combination of IC and IV stem cell administration. The novelty of the current UMSC01      treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via      IC and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not      predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be      minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and      concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive      patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion.    ","      Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the developed world, with global      deaths due to coronary artery disease estimated to increase from 7.3 million in 2008 to 25      million by 2020 WHO, 2011.      The leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic and therapeutic cascade in patients with      suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is chest pain.      Most patients will ultimately develop an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The      mainstay of treatment in these patients is immediate reperfusion by primary angioplasty or      fibrinolytic therapy. Basically, STEMI comprises approximately 25% to 40% of myocardial      infarction (MI) presentations. Acute STEMI is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and      disability.      This product is a new cell therapy product for treating AMI and produced by Ever Supreme Bio      Technology Co., Ltd in Taiwan. For animal studies, UMSC01 has been demonstrated its      effectiveness for AMI and stroke. The rats with coronary artery ligation receiving      intravenous injection of UMSC01 showed significantly improved cardiac function.    ",,"

","      This is a phase I, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled 9 subjects pilot safety run-in      followed by an additional 16 randomized subjects for a total of 25 subjects. In the pilot      phase subjects will be randomized into three treatment groups of allogenic mesenchymal stem      cells and in the randomized phase subjects will receive either allogenic mesenchymal stem      cells or matched placebo.    ","      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and debilitating lung disease      characterized by interstitial fibrosis with decreasing lung volumes and pulmonary      insufficiency eventually resulting in death. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis      (IPF) typically present with complaints of sub acutely progressive dyspnea and non-productive      cough, often accompanied by digital clubbing. Due to the insidious onset of symptoms,      however, most patients are diagnosed at late stages of the disease after significant fibrosis      has occurred. Physical exam is characterized by hypoxemia, ""dry"" inspiratory crackles on      auscultation, and occasional digital clubbing (6). Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) usually      reveal restrictive lung physiology with progressive decline of forced vital capacity (FVC),      diffusion capacity (DLCO) and six-minute walk distances. Diagnosis is established by the      pathologic finding of usual interstitial pneumonia (with sub epithelial fibroblastic foci) by      open lung biopsy (7), and/or by high resolution CT (HRCT) demonstrating the characteristic      findings of peripheral/basal sub pleural reticulonodular changes with fibrosis, honeycombing,      and traction bronchiectasis (8, 9).      The prognosis for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is uniformly poor. The      natural history of the disease is characterized by inexorable progressive decline      interspersed with ""exacerbations"" or periods of accelerated disease which are often fatal      (5). There are no FDA approved treatment options for patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary      Fibrosis (IPF) and thus no standard of care. In cases of patients under the age of 60 with      limited comorbid disease, lung transplant may be offered. Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary      Fibrosis (IPF) receive empiric treatment, supportive care alone, and more recently, are      offered enrollment in clinical trials.      The pathogenesis of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by epithelial cell      injury and activation with interstitial inflammation, fibroblast proliferation with      extracellular matrix collagen deposition, and eventual loss of function. Because mesenchymal      stem cells are known to home to sites of injury, inhibit inflammation, and contribute to      epithelial tissue repair, their use has been suggested as a novel therapy for the treatment      of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF).

",      This study will explore a new approach to treat patients with a medical condition known as      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have been resistant to previous treatments using a new      population of cells with capability to restore a normal immune system that will no longer      attack the body.      The stated hypothesis is that the SLE condition is caused by an abnormal immune system that      can be restored by replenishing the body with a new population of progenitor cells.    ,"      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of allogeneic bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stem cell (AlloMSC) transplantation in patients with refractory SLE.      Patients with Lupus nephritis and refractory to corticosteroid or cyclophosphamide trials      will be enrolled in this trial. The treatment intervention includes a 24 hour pretreatment      with cyclophosphamide followed by AlloMSC transplantation. Patients will be admitted to the      in-patient service for the 3-5 days for the transplant treatment and will be followed up in      the outpatient clinic. All baseline lupus serology, renal function panels will be obtained at      pre-treatment admission. Post-transplantation follow-up visits will be at monthly intervals      for lupus serology and renal function tests, and every 3 months for analysis of T regulatory      population. The transplanted patients will be evaluated by an integrated team of      rheumatologists, hematologists and bone marrow transplant specialists every month for the      entire duration of the trial (2 years) and every 6-12 months thereafter.

","      Approximately 10% of all female Crohn's patients have a rectovaginal fistula. Rectovaginal      fistulas cause air, stool, and/or drainage per vagina and may be associated with pain,      recurrent urinary tract infections and diminished quality of life. Conventional therapy      includes immunosuppressive medications used to treat Crohn's disease and various surgical      interventions. However, all have limited ability to heal these fistulas. The purpose of this      study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to treat people with rectovaginal fistulas in the setting of      Crohn's disease.    ","      This study is designed to determine the safety and efficacy of direct injection of adult      allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of rectovaginal      fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease. The study will randomize 20 participants.      Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with MSCs versus placebo in a 3:1      fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose      of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula      tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete      healing has been achieved patients will continue to be followed for one year. If complete      healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second      injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete      healing from placebo will cross over at the six month visit to receive an injection of MSCs,      and will be followed for one year after treatment for a total duration of 18 months.

","      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using adult allogeneic      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), to treat people for medically refractory      perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease.    ","      Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal      tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based      studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two      decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These      patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent      perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and      impaired quality of life.      Unfortunately, perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease is notoriously difficult to cure with 37%      of patients experiencing refractory disease. As a result, patients cycle through numerous      immunosuppressive medications that can have significant side effects, and >90% undergo      multiple surgical interventions putting them at risk of incontinence.      The specific rationale for MSCs in perianal Crohn's fistulas is based upon 1) their      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties; 2) several studies reporting the safety      and efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of perianal Crohn's fistula; 3) existence of safe      manufacturing methods for isolation and expansion of MSCs.      This study will enroll 20 participants that have Crohn's disease with medically and      surgically refractory perianal fistulizing disease. Participants enrolled will be those that      meet particular criteria for participation in the clinical trial.      Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with adult allogeneic bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stem cells, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the      treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will      be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula tract. Participants will be      evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete healing has been achieved,      participants will continue to be followed for one year. If complete healing has not been      achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the      same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete healing from placebo      will cross over at the 6 month visit to receive an injection of MSCs and again three months      after this as above, and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total duration of      18 months.

","      Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the procedure of      choice for patients with ulcerative colitis, familial adenomatous polyposis, and select      patients with Crohn's disease due to overall low patient morbidity and good quality of life.      However, some patients can develop Crohn's disease of the pouch, a clinical diagnosis of      Crohn's disease following IPAA. One of the manifestations of Crohn's disease of the pouch      includes a fistula from the pouch that travels to the vagina or perianal area. These fistulas      can be quite difficult to manage with medications and local surgical intervention, and, on      occasion result in a reconstruction pouch but more often require a pouch excision with      permanent end ileostomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of      using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to treat people who have a      peri-pouch fistula related to a clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease of the pouch.    ","      This aim of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of adult allogeneic bone      marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), for the treatment of medically refractory      peri-pouch fistulizing disease in the setting of Crohn's disease of the pouch. The study will      randomize 20 participants. Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with      MSCs, versus placebo in a 3:1 fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct      injection of MSCs at a dose of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in      and around the fistula tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three      months. If complete healing has been achieved participants will continue to be followed for      one year. If complete healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be      eligible for a second injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control      participants without complete healing from placebo will cross over at the 6 month visit to      receive an injection of MSCs and will be followed for one year after treatment to a total      duration of 18 months. The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at the month 6 time      point.    ",,"

","      This study will assess safety and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs,      administered by the nasal route, in neonates who suffered from PAIS.    ","      Perinatal arterial ischemic stroke (PAIS) is an important perinatal cause of long-lasting      neurodevelopmental problems. Recent studies report an incidence of PAIS of 1 per 2300      full-term infants born alive. Adverse consequences of PAIS include hemiplegia, cognitive      dysfunction, epilepsy and speech problems. In 50-75% of infants, neonatal stroke leads to      abnormal neuromotor and -developmental outcome or epilepsy. The estimated annual mortality      rate of neonatal stroke is 3.49/100,000 annually. Current treatment options for PAIS mainly      focus on controlling convulsions and associated infections. There is no treatment available      that leads to reduction of neonatal brain damage in this severely affected group of infants.      This leads to life-long consequences of PAIS and forms a large burden for patients and      society. The overall aim of this project is to meet this need by developing a cell based      treatment strategy. Animal models of neonatal brain injury provide evidence for the      feasibility and efficacy of intranasal mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) application in the      treatment of PAIS. Additionally, results from human trials with MSCs in the treatment of      adult stroke or other pathologic conditions provide evidence that MSC treatment is safe. This      project aims at making the first step towards clinical application of MSCs to treat PAIS.      Successful completion of this project will provide the first evidence of the safety and      feasibility of MSCs to treat brain damage in newborn infants. This study will assess safety      and feasibility of bone marrow-derived allogeneic MSCs, administered by the nasal route, in      neonates who suffered from PAIS.    ",,"

",      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and feasibility of allogeneic adipose      tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) injected into the lacrimal gland in a smaller      groups of 7 patients with Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye Disease (ADDE)    ,"      Dry eye disease (DED) is a very common problem seen in patients all over the world. According      to an older study the prevalence of DED in a Danish population 30-60 years of age was 11%.      Aqueous tear deficient dry eye (ADDE) is a subtype of DED in which the tear production in the      lacrimal gland (LG) is impaired. Current treatment of ADDE is only to relieve symptoms as a      curative treatment of ADDE does not exist.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reside in almost all connective tissues and are multipotent      stem cells with the capacity to differentiate into several kinds of tissue. Several studies      have shown that MSCs reduces inflammation in various diseases. Adipose tissue-derived MSCs      (ASCs) have gained considerable attention, since they are readily available from the      abdominal fat where it is most easily collected and expanded. In resting MSCs, MHC class II      is not expressed on the surface, which reduces the inherent immunogenicity of the cells. This      supreme attribute allows allogeneic MSC transplantation. Treatment with allogeneic MSCs have      been investigated in an extensive number of human subjects for various conditions in clinical      trials and no documented adverse events related to an anti-donor immune response exist. One      potential advantage of treatment with allogeneic cells is the possibility of their use as an      ""off-the-shelf"" therapeutic agent, avoiding the need for tissue collection and culture to      delay and increase the cost of treatment. It has also been suggested that the function of      autologous MSCs could be impaired in patients with comorbidities or advanced age.      In canines as in humans the most common cause of ADDE is an immune-mediated inflammatory      response targeting the LG. Two studies with injection of allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors      in a total of 48 eyes in 27 canines with ADDE have been performed with a significant increase      in tear production and no observed adverse events to the treatment.      Studies with injection of ASCs into the human LG has never been conducted. This present study      will test the hypothesis that injection of allogeneic ASCs into the LG in patients suffering      from ADDE is safe and increases tear production and reduces inflammation resulting in      increased ocular comfort.      7 patients with severe ADDE from Dept. of Ophthalmology, Rigshospitalet-Glostrup, will be      recruited if they are 1: eligible for the study and 2: sign the informed consent form.      At inclusion the participants will fill out the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)      questionnaire and undergo an eye examination in the following order:      measurement of tear osmolarity (TearLab™), tear break-up time (TBUT), ocular surface staining      according to the Ocular SICCA Grading Score, and Schirmer's I test.      After a maximum of 14 days from screening all participants will receive an injection with      ASCs into the lacrimal gland on one eye. If both eyes fulfill the eligibility criteria the      most affected eye with the lowest tear production assessed with the Schirmer's I test will be      the study eye; the contralateral eye will not be treated but examined according to the same      protocol as the study eye at each follow-up.      The product used is CSCC_ASC(22) and the dose injected contains approximately 11 million ASCs      per LG in a suspension with a total volume of 0.5 ml.      1 week (±2 days), 4 weeks (±4 days), and 4 months (±7 days) after intervention the      participants are followed up with eye examination as described above, OSDI questionnaire, and      blood test. At 4 months the primary outcomes of safety will be evaluated.      End of trial is defined as last participant's last visit (LPLV) at 3 years late follow-up.    ",,"

","      Septic shock is associated with substantial burden in terms of both mortality and morbidity      for survivors of this illness. Pre-clinical sepsis studies suggest that mesenchymal stem      (stromal) cells may modulate inflammation, enhance pathogen clearance and tissue repair and      reduce death. Our team has completed a Phase I dose escalation and safety clinical trial that      evaluated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patients with septic shock. The Cellular      Immunotherapy for Septic Shock (CISS) trial established that MSCs appear safe and that a      randomized controlled trial (RCT) is feasible. Based on these data, the investigators have      planned a phase II RCT (CISS2) at several Canadian academic centres which will evaluate      safety, signals for clinical efficacy, and continue to examine potential mechanisms of action      and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock.    ","      Septic shock is a devastating illness and the most severe form of infection seen in the      intensive care unit (ICU). It is characterized by cardiovascular collapse, failure of organs      and is common with severe repercussions including a mortality of 20-40%. Survivors suffer      long-term impairment in function and reduced quality of life (QOL). Despite decades of      research examining different immune therapies, none has proven successful and supportive care      remains the mainstay of therapy, at a cost of approximately 4-billion dollars in Canada      annually. MSCs represent a potentially novel treatment for sepsis because in animal models,      MSCs have been shown to modulate the immune system, increase pathogen clearance, restore      organ function, and reduce death.      The Phase II multi-centre Cellular Immunotherapy for Septic Shock RCT (CISS2) will continue      to evaluate safety, assess if there are signals for clinical efficacy and determine      mechanisms of action and biological effects of MSCs in septic shock. To answer these aims,      CISS2 will randomize 114 patients who are admitted to the ICU with septic shock to 300      million cryopreserved, allogeneic, bone marrow derived MSCs or placebo across 10 Canadian      centres over approximately 2 years.

",,"      Progressive SSc is an entity with limited therapeutic alternatives and with asurvival rate of      less than 45% in the first 3 to 5 years. The disease causessevere limitation in quality of      life ranging from functional limitation to depression. Up to 20% of patients will be      refractory to conventional treatment with diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and      cyclophosphamide therapy.This favors the progression to visceral involvement including      gastrointestinal,lung and pulmonary hypertension. The latter being a poor prognostic      factor,increases mortality in this group of patients and drastically affects their qualityof      life. For this reason, different therapeutic options have been considered including cell      transplantation and Stem Cell use. Among the options that have been studied so far are      stromal mesenchymal cells from Wharton ́s jelly. These have been used in intravenous infusion      or direct application in different disease scenarios ranging from vascular involvement to      interstitial lung involvement and cases of pulmonary hypertension, with promising results in      terms of clinical progression,improvement in quality of life and prognostic indices. This      therapy has proven to have a significant margin of safety at the time of administration and a      low rate of adverse events, a self-limiting fever as the most frequent event. Based on the      above and considering the possibility of offering patients without therapeutic alternatives      to their disease in addition to palliative options, an intravenous infusion of stromal      mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton ́s jellyis proposed for three patients with progressive      SSc refractory to conventional therapy with pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary      hypertension.      Under this premise the question posed in our work is; What are the effects of the infusion of      allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells from Wharton ́s jellyin patients with systemic sclerosis      refractory to conventional treatment with Methotrexate or Cyclophosphamide in a population of      three patients with severe pulmonary involvement due to pulmonary hypertension.    ","      This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cell      infusion as a treatment in patients with systemic sclerosis refractoryto conventional      therapy. The group of patients will be collected from the database of families of Stem      Regenerative Medicine according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and verified in the      academic committee.      The administration will be intravenously, with a concentration of 2 X 10^6 mesenchymal cells      per kilogram of patient weight. The infusions will be carried out nested at cyclophosphamide      application cycles ten days after each application of the cyclophosphamide schedule for each      patient. To assess safety and therapeutic effects, the occurrence of any adverse event will      be described from start of infusion until the conclusion of the trial in six months.      To assess the response, a pre-infusion and sixth-month post-infusion instrument will be      applied that includes clinical variables, paraclinical and hemodynamic tests to evaluate skin      involvement using the modified RODNAN score, changes in nail capillaroscopy, lung function      and structural involvement by high-resolution chest tomography (hrCT), diffusion capacity for      carbon monoxide (DLCO) and a 6-minute walk. As part of the cardiovascular assessment,      cerebral natriuretic peptide (BNP), transthoracic echocardiogramwill be performed; The      Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review(CAMPHOR) and Sysq will be used as tools for      the assessment of pulmonary hypertension. A comparison of these tests before initiation of      therapy and after completion of 24 weeks of infusion scheme should be performed.    ",,,,,"

",      The protocol is a phase I open label study evaluating the safety and feasibility of      peri-transplant infusion of freshly expanded interferon gamma primed MSCs in adult and      pediatric patients undergoing HCT for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).    ,"      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established therapeutic modality for high risk      hematological malignancies in adults and children. The primary cause of morbidity and      mortality after HCT is graft versus host disease (GVHD), affecting up to 70% of patients even      with current prophylaxis and directly accounting for approximately a third of regimen-related      death. Currently, pharmacologic prophylaxis consists of a calcineurin inhibitor and      methotrexate, a drug combination introduced around 40 years ago. Despite this regimen being      recognized as the standard of care, it is only partially effective, increases the risk of      infection and disease relapse and imparts drug-related, short- and long-term adverse effects.      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potent immune modulatory activity which is markedly      enhanced by exposure to interferon γ. In murine models, interferon γ (IFNγ) primed MSCs      (γMSCs) potently suppress GVHD without untoward adverse effects suggesting this cell therapy      may markedly reduce the regimen related toxicity of HCT; however γMSCs have never been      infused into patients.      This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that freshly expanded γMSCs can be reliably      produced and safely infused into patients undergoing HCT as GVHD prophylaxis.      This is an investigator-initiated Phase I study using a rolling 6, dose escalation design      with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual to the      pediatric tier will commence after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined in      adults. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for a future Phase II      study to demonstrate efficacy and support a Phase III randomized trial.      The researchers plan to enroll a minimum of 4 and maximum of 45 subjects who are greater than      1 year old. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after the HCT. The study will be      conducted at Emory University and will recruit participants from the Winship Cancer Institute      and Children's Hospital in Atlanta at Egleston.    ",,"
Non-Randomized
Sequential Assignment
This study uses a rolling 6 dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual in the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum dose tolerated has been determined in adults.
Treatment
None (Open Label)
","Number of successful preparations and deliveries of investigational productDay 1 (day of infusion)Feasibility will be documented by successful γMSC preparation and delivery to the bedside. If an adverse event precludes initiation or completion of the infusion, this MSC preparation/infusion will, nonetheless, be considered feasible. Processing scored as a not feasible will consist of a cell preparation does not meet release criteria., Number of adverse events attributed to the investigational productDay 2 (day after infusion)Safety will be assessed by toxicity grading according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (CTCAEv4). All recorded adverse events and serious adverse events will be documented and recorded. Their attribution to γMSCs will be determined. Dose limiting toxicity definition: For this study, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined as any grade ≥3 adverse reaction AND attributable to γMSCs (attribution listed as at least probable), occurring from γMSC infusion through the day of hematopoietic engraftment or 21 days of transplant, whichever is later., Maximal Tolerated DoseDay 2 (day after infusion)The maximal tolerated dose will be the dose at which 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 subjects demonstrates a DLT. If a dose of 10 x 106 γMSCs/kg is determined to be safe, then we will not determine the true MTD and accept 10 x 106 γMSCs/kg as the maximal dose.","
Primary graft failure
Up to Year 2
This endpoint will be defined as lack of neutrophil recovery (defined as ANC > 500/μL for three consecutive days) by 42 days post-transplant or neutrophil recovery with lack of myeloid donor chimerism. Relapse and death prior to neutrophil engraftment are considered competing risks for the endpoint of primary graft failure.
, 
Secondary graft failure
Up to Year 2
Secondary graft failure is defined as initial donor-derived neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in ANC to < 500/μL for fourteen consecutive measurements on different days, and unresponsive to growth factor therapy, with loss of donor chimerism to < 50%.
, 
Platelet engraftment
Up to Year 2
Platelet engraftment is defined as the first day of a minimum of three consecutive measurements on different days such that the patient has achieved a platelet count > 20,000/μL and > 50,000/μL with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of the three measurements will be designated as the day of platelet engraftment.
, 
Non-relapse mortality (NRM)
Up to Year 2
The event is death in continuous remission treating relapse as the competing risk. Patients alive and in remission at the time of last observation will be censored.
, 
Change in Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) Incidence
Day 30, Day 100
Incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD will be measured according to Revised Glucksberg criteria.
, 
Change in Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) Incidence
Day 30, Day 100, Day 180, Day 365
Incidence of chronic GvHD will be scored according to the recent NIH scoring.
, 
Disease-free survival (DFS)
Up to Year 2
Disease-free survival is defined as the minimum time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease, to death or to last follow-up.
, 
Primary cause of death
Up to Year 2
Primary cause of death will be classified as:
Relapse/Primary disease: If the patient relapsed/progressed after day 0 prior to death, the primary cause of death is relapse/progression, even if they subsequently developed GvHD, organ toxicities or infections that may have contributed to subsequent death. GvHD: Death from acute or chronic GvHD, in the absence of relapse or disease progression.
Infection: Death from documented viral, bacterial or fungal infections in the absence of GvHD or relapse/disease progression.
Organ toxicity: Death from major organ toxicities not attributable to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/MDS, infection or GvHD.
Other: Any other causes of death.
, 
Relapse
Up to Year 2
Testing for recurrent malignancy in the blood, marrow or other sites will be used to assess relapse after transplantation. For the purpose of this study, relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or MDS and including minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL consistent with pre-transplant features. The event for this endpoint is the time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease or to last follow-up. Death in remission is considered a competing risk.
, 
Early discontinuation
Up to Year 2
If a patient is enrolled on the study but does not start protocol treatment, a study exit form must be submitted documenting the reason for not starting protocol treatment. Such a subject will not be considered evaluable.
, 
Viral activation
Up to Day 100
Viral activations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will be documented. For the purpose of the study viral activation is defined as any polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay result considered positive by Laboratory Medicine which may or may not lead to the initiation of antiviral therapy as per institutional guidelines.
","
Drug
Interferon gamma (IFNγ)-primed human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells
To determine the maximal dose, initially adult subjects will receive a single infusion of third party, freshly ex vivo expanded, IFNγ-primed MSCs at a dose of 2 x 106 cells/kg of ideal body weight on Day +1 (the day after infusion of the hematopoietic cell graft). The dose will be escalated to 5 x 106 and then 10 x 106 cells/kg. In absence of any dose limiting toxicity, 10 x 106 cells/kg will be accepted as the maximal dose.
Subsequent participants in the adult and pediatric cohorts will receive the maximal dose as determined by the initial adult participants.
Participants will receive the infusion in an inpatient setting. MSCs will be intravenously infused through a central line or a large bore peripheral IV using standard blood product tubing within 4 hours of release. The product will be infused by IV push or syringe pump over 5 -15 minutes.

","      Previously, many studies have been conducted on mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone      marrow or subcutaneous fat, but interest in cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell      treatments has been increasing recently.      In the case of cord blood as a source, the isolation of mesenchymal stem cells is easier than      bone marrow or fat tissue, and cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells have an advantage as      a treatment because they have faster population doubling time.      To date, no clinical research on the treatment of patients using cord blood-derived      mesenchymal stem cells has been reported in the literature, but there have already been      registered at clinicaltrials.gov and currently being conducted overseas.      In this study, we will study the safety and effectiveness of RDEB patient treatment using      cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells with these advantages.    ","      Until now, all clinical trials for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) have      examined the potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs. However, umbilical cord blood (UCB) is      another important source of stem cells, since its non-invasive collection procedure and rapid      availability from cord blood banking. Human UCB-derived MSCs (hUCB-MSCs) exhibit high      proliferation capacity and low immunogenicity. A few data support that UCB-MSCs may have      significantly greater immunosuppressive potential than other sources of MSCs. A preclinical      study has demonstrated that systemic infusions of human UCB-derived unrestricted somatic stem      cells, a subpopulation of non-hematopoietic stromal stem cells, significantly extended the      life span and reduced blistering of RDEB mice model. Given the promising results of the      preclinical study, we conducted a first-in-human, phase 1/2a clinical trial of intravenous      administrations of allogeneic hUCB-MSCs in patients with RDEB to determine the safety,      tolerability, and potential efficacy.

","      In terms of the surgical treatment of the cartilage injury, various techniques and ways are      created to repair or regenerate articular surface of synovial joint following traumatic      damage or degeneration of the cartilage. The option for surgical treatments based on the size      and depth of the cartilage knee injury may include knee debridement, radiofrequency,      drilling, microfracture, mosaicplasty, allogenic osteochondral transplantation and autologous      chondrocyte transplantation. The first two techniques mentioned have been used in treating      the cartilage knee injury involving the partial defects meanwhile the latter techniques have      been used for Grade III and IV cartilage defects based on ICRS. However, most of the surgical      options up only provide more of Type I collagen rather than Type II collagen. The available      treatments are more symptomatic rather than preventive or regenerative. Stem cell has big      potential in this area where it has ability to differentiate to cartilage. As allogeneic      umbilical cord blood MSCs are readily available and can be administered immediately, this      study therefore aims to prove the efficacy of allogeneic umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal      stem cells (UC-MSCs) for treating large defects knee injury.      The study is a prospective, randomized controlled, open label, phase IIb clinical trial,      involving 50 patients with large defects of cartilage injury for follow-up duration of 24      months. Patients will be assigned into 2 arms; Arm A - 25 subjects will receive      Chondrocell-EX (UC-MSCs) and Arm B - 25 subject will receive marrow cellution. All patients      will undergo debridement prior to receiving their assigned treatment. The patients will be      assessed on KOOS, IKDC, VAS and MRI.    ",,,"

","      Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)      characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue      destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Bone marrow-derived      mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory response as      indicated by the investigator's pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .      Objective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue      repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells      (MSC) from healthy donors.      Study design: an explorative double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized (2:1) trial in 30      patients with moderate to severe emphysema who are scheduled for two separate sessions for      surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS). The study treatment is intravenous allogeneic MSC or      placebo treatment in between the first and second surgical session. Randomisation will      allocate 10 patients to receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg      to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients      to receive placebo) at week 4 and 3 before the second LVRS, and will allocate 10 patients to      receive 2 x 106 /kg body weight MSC in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg (at      a maximum of 200 x106 MSC per study participant) iv (or 5 patients to placebo) at week 12 and      11 before the second LVRS.      Main study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference      in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue      harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2      or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO      diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.    ","      Rationale: Pulmonary emphysema is a component of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)      characterized by chronic inflammation with neutrophils and monocytes mediating the tissue      destruction under the regulation of various types of lymphocytes. Since 25 years, patients      with moderate to severe emphysema are treated with inhaled or oral corticosteroids.      Currently, consensus is developing that this anti-inflammatory treatment is not effective to      halt progression of emphysema. Therefore, emphysema may be classified as steroid-resistant      and requires new anti-inflammatory treatment approaches, including cellbased therapies. Bone      marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells have potential to halt the progressive inflammatory      response in various diseases, including steroid-resistant transplant rejection, Crohn's      disease and possibly emphysema as indicated by our pilot study (CCMO NL28562.000.09) .      Objective: To determine whether patients with emphysema develop anti-inflammatory and tissue      repair responses by treatment with allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells      (MSC) from healthy donors.

Study population: patients between age 45 and 65; a gradient of emphysema severity towards      the lung apex as assessed by CT-derived lung densitometry and equally distributed between      left and right lung; FEV1 between 20% and 45% pred; Gas diffusion capacity between 30% and      45% pred. Intervention (if applicable): MSC infusions with cryo-preserved MSC in a dose of 2      x 106 /kg body weight in a range of 1.5 x 106 MSC/ kg to 2.5 x 106 MSC/ kg ( at a maximum of      200 x106 MSC per study participant) in a covered bag or NaCl 0.9% with 5% DMSO in a covered      bag, both produced in the GMP facility of LUMC.      Main study parameters/endpoints: the study has a co-primary endpoint. First, the difference      in expression of CD31 on cells per micrometer alveolar septae present in lung tissue      harvested at the second LVRS from patients who received MSC at 3 and 4 weeks prior to LVRS2      or placebo. Second, the difference between MSC and placebo treatment in change in CO      diffusion capacity over a period of 3 years following LVRS2.      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group      relatedness: LVRS is a routine procedure for treatment of emphysema and received a positive      recommendation from the Cochrane Institute. The dose of MSC has been infused in over 200      patients in LUMC only causing mild side effects like fever and headache, mostly related to      DMSO, which is present as a cryoprotectant in the verum. Placebo may also cause fever and      headache (DMSO). For the study, additional physical exams will be performed 6 monthly for a      period of 3 years after LVRS2 and additional blood sampling specific for the study protocol      will be 50ml in total. A heparinized blood sample of 10 ml per sample will be taken: 1) just      before the 1st LVRS while patient is under general anaesthesia, 2) just before the 1st MSC      iv, 3) just before the 2nd MSC iv, 4) just before the 2nd LVRS while the patient is under      general anaesthesia. Discomfort for the patient caused by the experimental treatment will be      minimal while there is no reason to assume that hospital admission for the surgery will be      prolonged by the cell therapy or placebo. The risks associated with the investigational      treatment are low as the reported adverse events in Toetsing Online from previous MSC studies      in LUMC show only mild to moderate severity. The risk-benefit analysis is low.    ",,"

","      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Adipose-derived      Mesenchymal Stem Cells (AD-MSCs) with moderate to severe psoriasis. Any adverse events      related to AD-MSCs infusion will be monitored. Safety is assessed using incidence of Adverse      Events(AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs). Efficacy is assessed via the proportion of the      improvement of PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index), relapse rate in treatment period,      changes in PASI score and BSA, as well as DLQI.    ","      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.      Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis.      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to      find new treatment for psoriasis.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem cells that can differentiate into      bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Adipos-derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells(AD-MSCs) were      isolated from fat tissues and were reported to treat moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris      and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports. For the mechanism of the disease,      involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells      (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation, migration to skin lesions,      limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that the injection of AD-MSCs      could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.    ",,"

Donor specific antibodies (DSA) in serum of patients will be measured and compared to baseline to determine if there is a development of antibody response to donor HLA (human leukocyte antigen). This will determine if there is a possibility of anti-donor alloimmune response after the first or second infusion of MSC, which might lead to a subsequent antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) with the following infusion. Testing will be done at the these time points to determine if 2nd or 3rd infusions will continue.

The Geriatric Depression Scale Short form (GDS-SF) is a 15-item screening tool that is used to identify depression in older adults. Answers indicating depression are in bold and italicized; score one point for each bold one selected. A score of 0 to 5 is normal. A score greater than 5 suggests depression and requires evaluation, whereas a score of 10 or greater would require evaluation for treatment .

","      Actively developing stem cells (SCs) transplantation techniques cause natural interest to the      problem of regeneration in the lungs. Numerous experimental studies proved the benefits of      different types of SCs in experimental models of pulmonary emphysema (PE).      G. Zhen et al. have shown that the transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rats      with papain-induced emphysema leads to their migration into the lungs, differentiation into      type 2 alveolocytes, and inhibition of apoptosis and prevention PE.      K. Schweitzer et al. have proved the activity of inflammation in the airways, alveolocytes      and endothelial cells apoptosis decreased after adipose SCs intravenous administration to      mice with emphysema caused by chronic exposure to tobacco smoke or VEGF receptors blockade.      The study of E.P. Ingenito et al. found that endobronchial installed MSCs engraft into the      alveolar wall and peribronchial interstitium and release integrins, extracellular matrix      components (collagen IV, laminin and fibrillin), platelet-derived growth factor receptor and      transforming growth factor β2.      Our study also found reliable deterrent effect of allogeneic bone marrow MSCs on the      development of elastase-induced emphysema in rats at different terms of transplantation.      After the success of pilot studies have started clinical trials. Currently, the website      http://www. ClinicalTrials.gov reported three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of      MSC transplantation in patients with COPD and emphysema. Two of them have already been      completed and the results of the first pilot project published.      Authors on the example of 4 patients showed a complete absence of adverse effects, improved      quality of life and stability of functional parameters at 12 months after starting treatment      One of the problems of MSC transplantation in patients with respiratory failure is an      accelerated apoptosis of transplanted cells under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines      and oxidative stress. Since it is proved that preconditioning MSCs under hypoxia increases      their survival in hypoxic conditions, increases the expression of growth factors and      antiinflammatory cytokines, we suppose that MSCs grown in hypoxic medium may have a      significant positive effect on the disease.

","      Demographics, baseline and follow-up characteristics: descriptive statistics. Primary      analysis: Descriptive statistics for the rate of patients with high grade AEs (grade 2 and      more), related to the cell implantation will be computed in each arm, with its two-sided 95%      CIs.      Each dose arm will be compared to the control arm by computing the absolute difference and      the relative risk between the active dose arm and the control arm, together with their 95%      two-sided CIs.      The p-values for the comparisons of the difference between the observed absolute rate to 0      and of the relative risk to 1 will be computed, but it is not expected that the study will      have sufficient power to detect a significant difference on either of the two statistics      (absolute difference or relative risk).      Primary efficacy analysis: The primary efficacy criterion (TcPO2) will be compared between      each dose group versus the control group to test for a superiority of MSC over control.      The tested hypotheses are:        -  Null hypothesis: mean (MSC dose i) ≤ mean (Control)        -  Alternative hypothesis: mean (MSC dose i) > mean (Control) A mixed - model for repeated           measures will be used to model the evolution of TcPO2 over time. The significance of the           time by treatment interaction will be used to test the two hypotheses. Model adjusted           means (LS means) and their differences between treatment arms will be computed at each           timepoint.      The LS-Means for change from baseline to 180 days will be used as the primary efficacy      endpoint.

","      This is a phase 1 clinical trial to verify the safety and efficacy of DW-MSC in COVID-19      patients. A total of 9 subjects are randomly allocated. Subjects who meet the final inclusion      and exclusion criteria are randomized to the test groups (low-dose group and high-dose group)      or control group (placebo group) in a ratio of 1:1:1. Subjects assigned to the test groups      were administered intravenously once with 5 x 10^7cells of DW-MSC for the low-dose group or 1      x 10^8cells for the high-dose group after registration. Subjects assigned to the control      group were administered with placebo in the same manner as the test drug (DW-MSC). At this      time, all of the existing standard co-treatment are allowed. DW-MSC is adjunct therapy to      standard therapy.      This clinical trial is a double-blind trial, in which a randomized method will be used. To      maintain the double-blindness of the study, statistician who do not participate in this study      independently generate randomization code. Subjects will be randomized to the test groups      (low-dose group and high-dose group) or the control group (placebo group) in a 1:1:1 ratio.      After the completion of the trial, the randomization code will be disclosed after unlocking      the database and unblinding procedures.

To date, the incidence rate has been      more than 3 million each year; however, as the increase and globalization of the      environmental pollution has been expanded, the number of patients is expected to increase due      to acute diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory virus, SARS, and coronavirus.      Since 2015, Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends to use stem cells for product research on rare      and intractable diseases including respiratory distress. Stem cells are also called      pluripotent cells or truncal cells that can convert to any organ. It is an embryonic stage      undifferentiated cell that has stopped differentiating before forming a specific organ whose      differentiation has not been determined and has the ability to differentiate into muscle,      bone, and internal conformal body organs. There are three types of stem cells: embryonic stem      cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Daewoong Pharmaceutical intends      to develop cell therapy products using mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).    ",,"

","      Despite significant progress in the treatment of interstitial lung disease, achieved thanks      to new drugs, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, there are many patients for whom these      drugs are not available or poorly tolerated. In addition significant evidence of their      effectiveness and safety is valid only for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The transplantation      of allogeneic stem cells is a promising direction in the modern medicine with the proven      safety for different diseases. But the effectiveness of this therapy is still under research.      We believe that in most severe cases of a rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease the      transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells may be an effective technology due to their      immunomodulatory properties.

","      Myocardial infarction causes necrosis of myocardial cells and reduces cardiac function. Today      there are treatments such as primary angioplasty and thrombolysis that are effective in      limiting cell death after acute myocardial infarction. However, the post-infarct scar often      conditions a global ventricular remodeling that can evolve clinically towards heart failure      and, in more advanced stages, the only therapy that completely restores cardiac function is      heart transplantation.      Experimental studies are evaluating new therapeutic approaches based on tissue engineering      for myocardial regeneration. Cardiac tissue engineering attempts to create functional tissue      constructs that can restore the structure and function of damaged myocardium.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells that develop from embryonic mesoderm and      are found in all structural tissues of the body.      In the field of cardiac regeneration, studies have shown a certain degree of benefit when      treated with MSCs from different origins. The investigators approach is based on a      decellularized matrix that carries the cells directly over myocardial infarction.      Among the different types of MSC currently available, the investigators propose the use of      those derived from the connective tissue surrounding the great vessels (2 arteries and one      vein) of the umbilical cord called Wharton's gelatin (MSC, WJ) whose immunomodulatory      properties are described extensively in the literature. These MSC, WJ cells have a PEI      approved by the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Healthcare Products (AEMPS) (PEI 16-017)      that guarantees an optimal manufacturing process for a clinical trial.

Changes in wound morphology
8 weeks
Clinical assessment of wound morphology (and its changes during the treatment) in each treated patient, as well, as between patients in both study arms, expressed as:
the amount (1) and features (2) of wound exudate,
the presence of redness (3) and/or edema (4) in the wound surrounding skin,
the presence of granular tissue and fibrin (5) or epithelium (6) in the wound bed.
The listed parameters will be assessed using simplified questionnaire adopted from Bates-Jensen Wound Assessment Tool (positions 7-13 from B-JWAT).
Each of 6 abovementioned features will be assessed semiquantitatively using 1-5 points scale, (with ""1"" for a best state, and ""5"" for a worst state). The sum of points allocated to each parameter will be recorded as the wound score and used for further analysis.
The healthy skin/healed wound should receive 6 points, whereas active wound, with exudate and inflammation will receive 30 points (the lower = the better / the higher = the worse).

Changes in the quality of life
8 weeks
Evaluation of the patient's quality of life, assessed by the dedicated QoL questionnaire. The QoL questionnaire consists of 10 questions. Each question is scored 1 to 5. The minimum score is 10 and it means ""the best possible state of health"", and the maximum score is 50, which means ,,the worst possible state of health"".

","      The Clinical trial is a phase I/IIa clinical study for treatment of knee osteoarthritis by      intra-articular injection of bone marrow derived allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells. Primary      endpoint of the study is safety of allogeneic BM-MSCs application on knee OA with single dose      IA injection and the MTD. Secondary endpoint is the effect of allogeneic BM-MSCs      transplantation including clinical and image observation since the MSCs have multi-lineage      differentiation potential such as chondrocyte differentiation, anti-inflammation and      immune-modulation.    ","      Osteoarthritis of the knee (Knee Osteoarthritis, Knee OA) is a joint disease that primarily      affects cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within the      joint. In people who suffer from knee OA, articular cartilage top is broken down and worn      away, resulting in the underlying bones to rub against each other. This friction can cause      pain, joint swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM). Eventually, the joint may become      deformed and bone spurs may form around the edges. With the advances in biotechnology, cell      therapy in the application of cartilage reconstruction has gradually matured. The purpose of      this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) injection of      allogeneic bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for knee OA. The same cell products      used in this trial have been applied in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in Taiwan for the      treatment of critical limb ischemia, and so far no treatment-related adverse effect has been      observed. In the current trial, allogeneic bone marrow MSCs of up to 4 donors will be      isolated. BM MSCs are expanded and applied for a phase I/IIa study in treating 15-24      recipient patients with knee OA. The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first      stage is a traditional 3+3 open dose-escalated study design with three cohorts of dosing      groups: (1) 1 x 10^7 cells, (2) 5 x 10^7 cells and (3) 10 x 10^7 cells. At the second stage,      knee OA patients will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as      determined by the results of the first stage. All the study subjects will be followed up to 6      months (24 weeks) after the treatment for safety and preliminary efficacy evaluation, which      the latter will include both clinical and imaging study assessments.    ",,"
Non-Randomized
Sequential Assignment
The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first stage is a traditional 3+3 dose-escalation open study design with three cohorts. At the second stage, a total of 6 patients with knee OA will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as determined by the results of the first stage.

In addition, this study will contribute much needed data to the clinical trials      community on the natural history of the motor function in CP over short-term (less than 1      year) time periods relevant to the conduct of clinical trials and assess the safety of AlloCB      and hCT-MSC infusion in children with cerebral palsy.    ","      This study is a phase I/II, prospective, randomized, open-label trial designed to determine      the effect size of change in GMFM-66 score in subjects treated with hCT-MSC or allogeneic CB      and assess the safety of repeated doses of hCT-MSC in children with cerebral palsy. Children      ages 2-5 years with cerebral palsy due to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, stroke, or      periventricular leukomalacia may be eligible to participate. All participants will ultimately      be treated with an allogeneic cell product at some point during the study. Participants will      be randomized to one of three arms: (1) the ""AlloCB"" arm will receive one allogeneic CB      infusion at the baseline visit; (2) the ""MSC"" arm will receive three hCT-MSC infusions, one      each at baseline, three months, and six months; (3) the ""natural history"" arm will not      receive an infusion at baseline but will receive an allogeneic CB infusion at 12 months.      Motor outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, six-months, and one-year time points.      Safety will be evaluated at each infusion visit and remotely for an additional 12 months      after the final visit. Duration of study participation will be 24 months from the time of      baseline visit. Randomization to treatment arms will be stratified by GMFCS level at study      entry and etiology of CP (Stroke vs. Other).    ",,"

","Change in Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-66) in Excess of Expected ChangeBaseline to 12 monthsGMFM-66 is used to evaluate gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy and is scored using a propriety software program called the Gross Motor Ability Estimator that produces an interval level continuous score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate better motor function. The primary endpoint in this study was computed from the GMFM-66 score in three steps: 1) The ""observed"" change in motor function from Baseline to Month 12 was calculated (positive values indicate improvement, negative values indicate reduction, and zero indicates no change) for each participant; and 2) The expected change in motor function was determined for each participant based on published growth curves; and 3) The expected change in GMFM-66 was subtracted from the observed change to yield the final primary outcome. Positive values indicate a greater change than would be expected, zero indicates change as expected, and negative values indicate a smaller amount of change than would be expected.","

","      The purpose of this multi-site, pilot study is to test whether infusions of human cord tissue      mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multi system inflammatory      syndrome (MIS-C). We will also describe the symptom course and duration of this      hyper-inflammatory syndrome in these patients. Six patients less than 21 years old with MIS-C      that is refractory to intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and/or steroids will be given      intravenous infusions of hCT-MSCs. Doses of 2x10^6 cells/kg (up to a maximum dose of 100x10^6      cells) will be given on days 1, 2, 3, +/-7 (day 7 is optional). Participants will be followed      up to 90 days after administration for severe adverse events and survival. Safety will be      evaluated through adverse event monitoring, clinical evaluations (i.e., vital signs, physical      examinations), laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, serum chemistries, and urinalysis), and      cardiac function (i.e., echocardiogram, ECG) from the signing of informed consent and      throughout the patient's participation in this treatment protocol.    ","      This phase I, multisite, pilot study will test whether infusions of human cord tissue derived      MSCs (hCT-MSC) are safe in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).      The study population will consist of six patients 18 to <21 years old with a life expectancy      ≥ 72 hours and COVID-19 related MIS-C that is refractory to treatment with intravenous immune      globulin (IVIG).      Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly recognized, serious,      hyper-inflammatory syndrome that is occurring in small numbers of children, many of whom are      within a month or so of recovering from a COVID-19 infection. While the clinical presentation      varies, affected patients are typically previously healthy individuals who are less than 21      years of age. The diagnostic criteria include fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and      multisystem involvement requiring hospitalization. Up to 75% of patients present with an      element of cardiogenic shock requiring inotropic support, with some also requiring intubation      with mechanical ventilation. Reported supportive treatments have included intravenous immune      globulin (IVIG), tocilizumab, methylprednisolone, and aspirin. In the limited cases reported,      up to 50% of children with MIS-C have antibodies to COVID-19 in their blood and may or may      not be PCR positive on a nasal swab or throat culture. The disease is incompletely understood      but currently believed, at least in part, to be a hyper-immune response to a recent COVID-19      infection.      In laboratory experiments, MSCs have been shown to inhibit T-cell proliferation and decrease      production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In animal models, up to 70% of infused cells are      engulfed by lung macrophages, leading to secretion of anti-inflammatory molecules by these      macrophages. These observations have led to the hypothesis that MSCs may work through both      anti-inflammatory, immune-modulatory, and regenerative mechanisms.      Over the past several months, MSCs have been tested in small cohorts of adult patients with      COVID-19 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome to determine if the cytokine storm hypothesized      to cause this complication could be suppressed by MSCs. Early results are encouraging, and      formal clinical trials are underway. Extending this work into the pediatric population, the      hypothesis of this study is that infusion of hCT-MSC can reverse the pro-inflammatory state      in children with MIS-C.      This is a 6 patient, multisite, pilot study to test whether infusions of hCT-MSC are safe in      pediatric patients with MIS-C. Information will also be gathered about the duration and      severity of the participant's multisystem inflammatory syndrome. hCT-MSCs will be      manufactured at Duke University Medical Center in the Robertson GMP Cell Manufacturing      Laboratory and shipped frozen to the treatment site, where they will remain stored in the      vapor phase of liquid nitrogen until the day of dosing.      The baseline evaluation will include vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature,      respiratory rate), echocardiogram, ECG or telemetry strip, HLA typing, Panel Reactive      Antibody (anti-HLA antibody), inflammatory markers, blood counts, blood chemistry,      coagulation, and COVID-19 PCR and antibody tests.Patients will be dosed with 2x10^6      hCT-MSCs/kg. Doses will be given on days 1, 2, 3, and a fourth, optional dose may be given on      day 7 at the discretion of the investigator and the treating physician. Prior to the      infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Hydrocortisone, 0.5mg/kg each) will be administered. The      hCT-MSCs will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes via a syringe pump. Pulse      oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluids will be managed      by the care team. Afterwards, the participant will continue to be monitored in their care      setting per institutional standards. Participants will be evaluated by study staff the day      after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related adverse reactions or complications.      The participant will be monitored by study staff to assess for any infusion related adverse      reactions or complications until discharge. Additional follow-up will occur on days 14, 28,      and 90. Follow up testing will include assessment for adverse events as well as the tests      done at baseline (with the exception of HLA typing and COVID PCR.    ","

",      This study aims to examine the short term and long term safety outcomes of the treatment of      PD patients with umbilical cord derived stem cells as indicated by the presence of adverse      events that are confirmed to be related to the therapy.    ,"      This study is predicted to confirm the safety of the use of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell      (MSCs) differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) in one of the most common neurological      diseases. It will also aid in the better understanding of the role of stem cell therapy in      relation to motor and non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinson disease. The safety      outcomes would encourage launching similar larger studies. And also to facilitate the      treatment and outcome results by giving differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into      neural stem cells (NSCs) rather than allow the cells to differentiate inside the body. While      the efficacy results if encouraging, would mean an improvement in the disability associated      with PD and reduction in the life-time care and treatment provided to this category of      patients in Jordan and the Arab region.

HAM and HUMCWJ Injections
SURGENEX SurForce® (1cc) allograft placental based tissue matrix, will be injected using a 22 gauge, 2-inch needle. The injection site (medial, lateral, patellar) will be determined based on the side with the most joint space from the findings of the most recent x-rays. The Physician will insert the needle fully into the joint space and begin to expel the fluid. He will achieve a continuous injection flow as he withdraws the needle back out of joint space. Immediately following the SURGENEX SurForce® injection, an injection of Predictive Biotech CORECYTE(TM) (1 cc) allograft umbilical cord-derived Warton's Jelly tissue matrix will be administered. This will be done using the exact same protocol as the SURGENEX SurForce® injection.

","      Osteodysplasia or poorly formed bones, ""brittle bones"" is a genetic disease with no known      proven treatments. Some forms of osteodysplasia may cause severe disability and even death.      Eligible patients were limited to those children with Osteodysplasia who had undergone a      previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant at St. Jude. The study intervention involved an      infusion of a specified number of ex vivo expanded stromal cells obtained from the bone      marrow of the same donor from whom they received their primary transplant procedure. These      bone marrow stromal cells can become bone-forming cells, called osteoblasts. Participants      then received 2 infusions of ex vivo expanded, gene marked cells not less than 6 months after      bone marrow transplantation. The second cell infusion occurred between 14 to 21 days after      the first infusion in the absence of toxicity. The goal of the study was to evaluate the      safety and toxicity of these infusions.

Marrow stromal cell infusion
This is a pilot study of infusions of ex vivo expanded, gene marked donor bone marrow stromal cells following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The study is a within patient dose escalation safety evaluation. It is believed that this patient population may benefit from these donor stromal cell infusions.
As the stromal cells will be obtained from the original stem cell donor, no conditioning is required.
Patients will receive two infusions of mesenchymal cells (MSC) approximately 14 to 21 days apart unless there is unacceptable toxicity after the first infusion. The first dose of cells to be given will be 1x10^6 MSC/kg and the second dose of cells will be 5x10^6 MSC/kg. The patients will be followed for approximately 28 days following the second infusion for any toxicity. Only after all six patients have safely completed both infusions will we consider 5 x 10^6 MSC/kg a safe dose of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells for infusion.

The first six subjects received allo-MSC therapy      (open label) and were assessed for safety and feasibility of the study procedures. Following      1 month data review of each of the six subjects by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood      Institute Gene and Cell Therapy Data Safety Monitoring Board; this was followed by a      randomized, double-blind clinical trial enrolling thirty-one subjects. These subjects were      randomized 1:1 to receive allo-MSCs or placebo. All subjects underwent cardiac      catheterization and study product administration using the NOGA Myostar catheter injection      system. Subjects are being followed at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months post      study product injection. All endpoints are assessed at the 6 and 12 month visits which will      occur 180 ±30 days and 365 ±30 days, respectively, after the day of study product injection      (Day 0). For the purpose of the safety evaluations and endpoint analysis, the Investigators      will utilize an ""intention-to-treat"" study population. In addition, because this phase I      study is the first cell therapy study in this population, at 12 months available      standard-of-care medical records for cancer surveillance will be reviewed for cancer      recurrence.

",      The goal of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic Wharton's      jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells administration in the individuals with diagnosed      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.    ,"      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the progressive neurodegenerative disorders,      affecting upper and lower motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord.      Hence, the signs of damage motor neurons are both at the peripheral (eg. atrophy), and      central (eg. spasticity) level. There is no effective treatment for ALS and the majority of      patients die within 5 years after diagnosis, usually due to the respiratory failure. Numerous      studies on murine models revealed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) successfully improve the      clinical and pathological features of ALS patients. The goal of this nonrandomized, open      label study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of allogeneic Wharton's      jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation into the individuals with diagnosed      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This clinical trial is conducted to test the therapeutic      (neuroprotective and paracrine) effect of allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem      cells (WJ-MSCs). All patients enrolled will have a documented history of ALS disease prior to      enrollment. Patients are recruited for a clinical trial no more than 1 year from the disease      diagnosis. Then, patients are divided into two groups: Group I - patients receiving      intrathecally one application of WJ-MSCs and Group II - patients receiving intrathecally      three applications (each administration every two months) of WJ-MSCs. Subsequently,      allogeneic Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cell transplantation to the cerebrospinal      fluid at the site of the spinal cord will be performed. Finally, treatment safety, adverse      events and exploratory parameters, including electromyographic (EMG) studies, forced vital      capacity (FVC) and functional rating scale (FRS) to establish ALS progression rate will be      recorded throughout the duration and in the post-treatment follow up period.

","      Now it is commonly accepted that MSC produce an immune-tolerant environment in different      settings. It has been shown (mainly for BM-MSC) that MSC can down-regulate T cells      activation. This characteristic of BM derived MSC already has clinical implications and shows      their potent effectiveness both in prophylaxis and treatment of resistant GvHD. Ongoing      clinical trials of use bone marrow MSC for treatment of steroid resistant GvHD are      successfully run on and some bone marrow donor registries included BM-MSC as a material for      donation. According to our preclinical studies MSC from cells from marrow, placenta,      umbilical cord vessels demonstrate similar pronounced immunosuppressive effect both with      autologous and allogeneic lymphocytes. Our preliminary clinical experience shows that BM-MSC      is an effective tool for treatment of steroid resistant GVHD. Present study aimed to      demonstrate if human UC-MSC has in vivo immunosuppressive effect and can be used for GVHD      treatment    ",,,"

",,"      The drug for this submission is Hope Biosciences' allogeneic, first blood relative,      adipose-derived culture-expanded mesenchymal stem cells (HB-adMSCs) for the treatment of a      single patient with Pancreatic Cancer (PC). PC is an extremely infiltrative neoplasm that      usually presents with vascular and perineural invasion in surgically resected tumors.      Metastases to lymph nodes, liver and distant sites are all very common. Its incidence has      markedly increased over the past several decades and ranks as the fourth leading cause of      cancer death in the United States. Despite the high mortality rate associated with pancreatic      cancer, its etiology is poorly understood. PC patients experience physiological symptoms such      as anemia, ascites, severe fatigue, pain, cachexia, weakness, insomnia, confusion, and memory      loss. The aggressive nature of PC leads to rapid deterioration of patients' quality of life      and diminished ability to participate in treatment.    ","      Once the eligibility is confirmed, approximately 1-3 weeks after the screening/baseline      visit, the subject will return for the first infusion. Subsequent treatments will occur      weekly for the first 8 infusions, followed by 4 infusion that occur 2 weeks apart. The total      number of infusions will be 12.      On each of these visits, the subject will receive one allogeneic HB-adMSC infusion of 200      million (2 x 10^8 cells) total cells suspended in 250 mL normal saline for IV infusion. Every      infusion visit will include the following procedures:        1. Review of medical history,        2. Complete Physical exam (Week 1, 4, 10, 20, and 52),        3. Vital signs (Heart Rate, BP, Respirations, Temp., SpO2),        4. Weight measurement        5. A verification of patient consent will be verbally performed        6. *When applicable (Week 4, 7, 10, 14, 20 and 52): A urine and blood sample for clinical           labs including:             -  CBC with diff.,             -  CMP,             -  Coagulation Panel,             -  TNF-a             -  IL-6             -  CA 19-9             -  LDH        7. The HB-adMSC infusion will be given via IV.        8. The subject will then be monitored for a minimum of 2hr after infusion.        9. 24-hour telephone assessment for adverse events       10.

","      This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects and best method of delivery of      bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in improving heart function in patients      with heart failure caused by anthracyclines (a type of chemotherapy drug used in cancer      treatment). MSCs are a type of stem cell that can be removed from bone marrow and grown into      many different cell types that can be used to treat cancer and other diseases, such as heart      failure. Bone marrow derived MSCs may promote heart muscle cells repair and lead to reverse      remodeling and ultimately improve heart function and decrease morbidity and mortality from      progression to advanced heart failure.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered      by intravenous infusion in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and heart failure      secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion in      patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%)      and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.      ARM I: Patients receive allogeneic hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes once weekly      for 4 weeks and standard of care drugs for heart failure.      ARM II: Patients receive only standard of care drugs for heart failure.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months and then      at 12 months.    ",,"

","      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of Mesenchymal Stromal Cell (MSC)      implantation on pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth with pulp necrosis and      chronic apical periodontitis.      BACKGROUND:        -  Post-traumatic pulp necrosis prevents root development in children and adolescents.        -  The multipotent ability of MSC to differentiate into bone-forming cells (osteoblasts)           and dentin-forming cells (Odontoblast) has allowed the development of protocols to           induce dental pulp regeneration in preclinical models and patients with immature teeth           with pulpal necrosis.      IMPACT:        -  Worldwide, post-traumatic pulp necrosis in children and adolescents constitutes a health           problem in the endodontic area.        -  Treatment with MSC would provide an effective therapeutic alternative to patients with           pulp necrosis and incomplete root formation.        -  The possible pulp and periapical regeneration of immature teeth induced by MSC would           have a huge impact on the treatment of these patients.      Eligibility for EMC implant study Age: 6 to 16 years Sex: Male or Female Healthy volunteers      accepted: NO.      TREATMENT GROUPS:      In the present study, the implantation of MSC will be performed in patients with immature      teeth with pulpal necrosis with apical periodontitis, who will receive the appropriate      endodontic treatment (according to the guidelines of the American Association of Endodontics)      and implantation of allogeneic BM-MSC . This group will be compared with the history made in      the Postgraduate Endodontics of the Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) and with      international case series made by revascularization.      Clinical follow-up of each patient:        1. Clinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal           and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0,           7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the           two years post-implantation of MSC.        2. Radiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364.           Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of MSC.        3. A tomographic evaluation will be performed when was evident periapical repair in a           periapical radiograph. To measure root formation, root canal narrowing and verification           the periapical repair in 3D.    ","      The endodontic procedure in the patients included in this study will focus on cases of pulp      necrosis with apical periodontitis without evidence of infectious processes.      MATERIALS AND METHODS. Reagents Murine monoclonal antibodies, directed against human      differentiation antigens (CD34, CD45, CD14, CD90, CD73, CD29, CD49b, CD166), conjugated to      fluorescein isothiocyanate (CFI) or phycoerythrin (PE) were purchased from BD Biosciences      (USA).      Isolation and culture of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) obtained from human bone marrow. In      the present study, isolated EMFs from bone marrow (BM) from patients with a diagnosis of      post-traumatic nonunion (failure of a bone union at fracture sites) will be used. These cells      were transplanted into the pseudoarthrosis site to induce bone regeneration in these      patients. The protocol for bone regeneration through EMF transplantation was carried out at      the University Hospital of Caracas, Hospital Universitario de Los Andes, Hospital Pérez de      León II and has the approval of the Bioethics Committees of each institution and each patient      through informed consent. In this protocol, the BM of each patient was isolated by a puncture      in the iliac crest. This procedure was performed in the operating room, under anesthesia and      by a medical specialist. The MO aspirate was placed in alpha-MEM medium (Invitrogen, USA)      with heparin (Sanofi Aventis). The mononuclear cells were separated by centrifugation on a      Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and cultured in alpha-MEM-Chang medium      (Irvine Scientific, USA) enriched with 20% autologous serum. These cells were kept in culture      in a controlled environment at 37ºC and 5% CO2. After 72 hours, non-adherent cells were      eliminated, and a basal culture medium (alpha-MEM-Chang / 20% autologous serum) was added.      Their adherence to the plastic isolated the MSCs. Culture medium exchanges were made until      reaching a confluence close to 70-80%. The MSCs were expanded by pealing the cultures,      following the process described above. Microbiological examinations were performed after      obtaining the BM and before performing the MSC implantation. After using MSC, a batch of      these cells were cryopreserved at -70 -C.      Phenotypic characterization of MSC. Phenotypic characterization studies of MSC were carried      out by flow cytometry. For which the MO adherent cells were detached from the culture flask      by using trypsin-like enzymes. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with antibodies      specific for MSC markers (CD90, CD73, CD105, CD29, CD166 and CD49b) and hematopoietic (CD34,      CD45 and CD14). Cytometric analysis of the expression markers showed that 100% of the cells      used for transplantation in each patient were MSC.      MSC differentiation studies. The multipotential differentiation capacity of MSCs was examined      by culturing these cells in osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation media,      following a methodology similar to that previously described. Briefly, the MSCs were detached      and seeded in 24-well culture plates at a cell density of 5x104 per well, proceeding to add      the corresponding differentiation medium. For osteogenic differentiation, MSCs were cultured      in the presence of basal medium enriched with dexamethasone (100nM, Biotech), ascorbic acid      (10mM, Sigma), inorganic phosphate (1.8mM, Merck) and beta-glycerol phosphate (2mM, Sigma).      For chondrogenic differentiation, cells were cultured in a commercial medium for chondrocytes      (Cell Application, USA) and for differentiation towards the adipogenic lineage the commercial      medium NH Adipodiff Human (Miltenyi, USA) was used. In all cases, the cells were kept in      culture for 21-28 days with medium changes every 4-5 days. To demonstrate the changes      associated with the differentiation process, the cells were fixed using paraformaldehyde      (Merck, USA) and specific stains were performed for each case. Briefly, alizarin red to      detect calcium deposition (evidence of osteogenesis), Alcian blue to detect proteoglycans      (evidence of chondrogenesis), and oil red (Oil Red) to see lipids (evidence of adipogenesis).      In all cases, microscopic observation and photographic registration were carried out. For      endothelial differentiation (CEn), EMFs were cultured in MCDB 131 medium (Invitrogen, USA)      enriched with 10% autologous serum, 10µg / ml of human epidermal growth factor (hu-EGF, R&D)      and hydrocortisone (1µg / ml, Sigma).      MSC implantation in patients with pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis. All MSC processing      procedures will be carried out in the cleanroom of the IVIC Cell Therapy Unit following the      standards of good manufacturing practice (GMP). Allogeneic BM-MSC from patients diagnosed      with post-traumatic nonunion and treated with implantation of these cells will be used to      induce bone regeneration. The MSC to be used in this protocol have previously been      phenotypically and functionally characterized. The MSC will be thawed, grown and expanded as      previously described. A part of the cells will be kept in a medium for MSCs, and another part      will be cultured in endothelial differentiation medium (CEM-Endo). Once the required number      of MSCs and MSCs-Endo have been reached, a suspension of these cells (75,000 cells from each      of them) will be placed in sterile culture tubes containing DMEM-F12 culture medium, without      phenol red, supplemented with 20% autologous serum. Each tube containing MSC / MSC-Endo will      be transported in a small biological sample transport cellar, at room temperature, to the      Dentistry Service of the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas (IVIC).      Under sterile conditions, the patient will be locally anesthetized in the affected tooth      area; the root canal of the affected tooth will be exposed and prepared to perform the MSC /      MSC-Endo / PRP implant. At the same time, the culture medium supernatant is removed from each      tube and the CEM / CEM-Endo ""button (pellet)"" is resuspended in autologous platelet-rich      plasma (PRP). Subsequently to the MSC / Endo / PRP suspension, 5% CaCl2 and thrombin will be      added. Immediately, and before the clot forms, 20 microliters of the CEM / CEM-Endo / PRP      suspension will be placed in the root canal, covered with a collagen membrane. Subsequently,      the obturation procedure with bioceramics will be carried out at the level of the pulp      chamber, ionomeric glass to protect the bioceramic and later composite resin to restore the      tooth.      Post-implantation clinical evaluation of EMF        1. Clinical controls (facial evaluation, gingival evaluation, apical palpation, horizontal           and vertical percussion, cold and heat sensitivity tests) will be carried out on days 0,           7, 30, 90, 180 and 364. Additionally, a clinical evaluation will be carried out at the           two years post-implantation of EMC.        2. Radiological controls will be carried out on days 0, 7, 30, 90, 180 and 364.           Additionally, they will be carried out two years post-implantation of mesenchymal           stromal cells.        3. A tomographic evaluation will be performed when the periapical repair will be evident in           a periapical radiograph.    ",,"

And it explores the expectations of patients for the treatment      of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their expectations to      participate in this study. The trial would provide preliminary data for large sample clinical      randomized controlled trials.    ,"      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to      find new treatment for psoriasis.      As current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively      small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine      in the treatment of psoriasis.      This study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben      Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the      treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and      efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic      AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.

",      In a dose escalation study we will determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of      allogeneic bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bmMSCs) in the induction of response for      active fistulizing Crohn's Disease (CD).    ,"      Despite the introduction of anti-TNFa (tumor necrosis factor alpha) therapy, perianal disease      still accounts for a high rate of morbidity in patients diagnosed with CD. Recently, a phase      II multicenter randomized study was reported showing that expanded adipose tissue derived      mesenchymal stem cells (atMSCs) in combination with fibrin glue was an effective and safe      treatment for complex perianal fistula. However, dose escalation of allogeneic bone marrow      (bm) MSCs for the local treatment of perianal fistulas has not been studied.      In this study, three escalating doses will be tested in a total of three cohorts. MSC      implantation will be preceded by surgical localization, curettage of the fistulous tract and      closure of the internal opening. Per cohort, patients will be randomized in a 5:2 fashion to      receive either 10x10^6 (cohort 1), 30x10^6 (cohort 2) or 90x10^6 (cohort 3) bmMSCs or no      cells (control group).      The primary endpoint will be assessed at week 12: i) the number of adverse and serious      adverse events and ii) a reduction in the number of draining fistulas, which is defined as      absence of discharge and absence of collections of ≥2 cm directly related to the treated      fistulas tracts as measured by MRI.

","      The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases.      Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow or adipose tissue (ASCs) have      proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease. Both      of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated      their ability to evade recognition and actively suppress the immune system.      This knowledge is transferred into studies with COVID-19 patients having severe pulmonary      dysfunction, to modify the virus induced immunological and inflammatory activity involved in      the progression of disease often leading to prolonged ICU stay and in some occasion's death.      We will conduct a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary      symptoms will be randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic CSCC_ASCs from      adipose tissue. The aim is to assess the impact of CSCC_ASCs on the activated immune system      and clinical efficacy on pulmonary function.      The perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be      a paradigm shift for the clinical problems and severe outcome seen in some patients with      severe COVID-19 and other severe diseases with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.

","      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of AloCELYVIR, which consist in      bone marrow-derived allogenic mesenchymal stem cells infected with an oncolytic Adenovirus,      ICOVIR-5. It has recently been proven that this type of cells are able of transporting      oncolytic substances to tumor targets that are difficult to reach, such as medulloblastomas      and gliomas, youth cancers located in the cranial cavity that have a poor prognosis and a      fatal outcome. In addition, to exerting an anti-tumor action, this virus has the ability to      stimulate the immune response, making the therapy even more effective. Thus, the diffuse      intrinsic pontine glioma and the medulloblastoma in relapse/progression have been chosen to      study the potential of this new advanced therapy through a weekly infusion for 8 weeks.

Changes from Baseline evaluated by MRI
24 months
Imaging evaluation by 2 independent radiographic interpretations to determine presence of effusions, bone marrow lesions/peri-articular edema, osteophytes, or any degree of facet synovitis
, 
Change in number of red blood cells following treatment
24 months
Blood will be drawn in order to monitor for markers of systemic inflammation. The normal range of red blood cells varies slightly between laboratories but is generally between 4.2 - 5.9 million cells/cmm. This can also be referred to as the erythrocyte count and can be expressed in international units as 4.2 - 5.9 x 10^12 cells per liter.
, 
Change in white blood cells with differential following treatment
24 months
Serological test - Automated white cell differential. A machine generated percentage of the different types of white blood cells, usually split into granulocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.
, 
Change in number of platelets following treatment
24 months
Serological test: Platelets are not complete cells, but actually fragments of cytoplasm from a cell found in the bone marrow called a megakaryocyte. Platelets play a vital role in blood clotting. Normal range varies slightly between laboratories but is in the range of 150,000 - 400,000/ cmm (150 - 400 x 10^9/liter).
, 
Change in Serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP)
24 months
Serological test: C-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation throughout the body. It is one of a group of proteins called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. C-reactive protein is measured in milligrams of CRP per liter of blood (mg/L). Normal CRP levels are below 3.0 mg/dL.
, 
Change in Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)
24 months
Serological test. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate at which red blood cells sediment in a period of one hour. It is a common hematology test, and is a non-specific measure of inflammation. The normal range is 0-22 mm/hr for men and 0-29 mm/hr for women.
, 
Change in Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) test measures the amount of nitrogen in the blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made when protein is broken down in the body. Urea is made in the liver and passed out of the body in the urine. A BUN test is done to see how well the kidneys are working. Results of the blood urea nitrogen test are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL).
, 
Change in Creatinine
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscles from the breakdown of a compound called creatine. Almost all creatinine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine, so blood levels are usually a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working. Results are reported in mg/dL.
, 
Change in Sodium
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. A sodium blood test allows the doctor to see how much sodium is in the subject's blood. It helps maintain normal blood pressure, supports the work of your nerves and muscles, and regulates your body's fluid balance. A normal sodium level is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) of sodium.
, 
Change in Potassium
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal potassium level in the blood is 3.5-5.0 milliEquivalents per liter (mEq/L).
, 
Change in Chloride
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal blood reference range of chloride for adults in most labs is 96 to 106 milliequivalents (mEq) per liter.
, 
Change in Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. Inflamed or injured liver cells leak higher than normal amounts of certain chemicals, including liver enzymes, into the bloodstream, which can result in elevated liver enzymes on blood tests. The reference range for aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is as follows: Males: 6-34 IU/L, Females: 8-40 IU/L.
, 
Change in Glucose
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. For a subject without diabetes, a fasting blood sugar on awakening should be under 100 mg/dl.
, 
Change in Carbon Dioxide
24 months
Serological test - basic metabolic panel. The normal range for carbon dioxide is 23 to 29 mEq/L (milliequivalent units per liter of blood).

","      Novel Coronavirus (2019nCoV) or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)      that causes Coronavirus Disease 2019, or known as Covid-19 has recently become a global      health emergency since it was first detected in Wuhan, the People Republic of China in      December 2019. Since then, the prevalence has rapidly increased worldwide. In Indonesia, by      the end of April 2020, around 10,000 patients have been tested positive for Covid-19      infection, with a case fatality rate of around 8%.      The pathogenesis of Covid-19 is still under investigation and to our understanding, ACE2      receptors in the alveoli serve as the binding site of the S-protein of envelope spike virus      of SARS-CoV-2. TMPRSS2 enzyme aids the fusion between cell membrane and capsid of the virus,      allowing penetration of virus into the cell. Vesicles containing virion fuse with cell      membrane and released as new virions. Cytopathic effect of the virus and its ability to      overcome immune response determines the degree of infection.      Differences in immunological profile among degrees of severity of Covid-19 may vary      especially for the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha      (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, leukemia-inhibiting factors (LIF), immunological      markers such as CXCR3+CD4+, CXCR3+CD8+ T cell and CXCR3+ NK cells, implying the ongoing      cytokine storm. The previous studies also found increasing number for infection markers such      as procalcitonin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein. The decreasing number of      anti-inflammatory cytokines in such as IL-10 also supports this finding.      Previous studies have shown immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory capacity of the      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs contributed to the shifting of pro-inflammatory Th2 into      anti-inflammatory Th2. One of the most recent study on the usage of MSCs on Covid-19 patients      showed increased expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which give rise to      inhibitory effect of T lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell population. Vascular      epithelial growth factor (VEGF) is found increasing following MSCs administration, which      indicates the ability to improve the disrupted capillaries due to SARS-Cov-2 infection. The      ability of MSCs in differentiating to alveolar cells is proven by the presence of SPM and      SPC2, surfactant proteins produced by type II alveolar cells. MSCs are unable to be infected      by SARS-CoV-2 since they don't have ACE2 receptors and TMPRSS2 enzyme.    ","      This study is a double blind, randomized control trial (RCT). This study will be concluded in      2 months, from May to July 2020, from subject selection to the end of follow up. Research      subjects are obtained consecutively from Covid-19 patients who receive care in the intensive      care unit (ICU) across four Covid-19 referral hospitals, including Persahabatan Hospital,      Sulianti Saroso Center for Infectious Disease, Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital, and      Universitas Indonesia Hospital, with 10 subjects obtained from each hospital and total 40      subjects for this RCT. Subjects from each hospitals are divided into control and experimental      groups. Subject belongs to the control group will receive standardized therapy (consisting of      oseltamivir and azithromycin), whereas subjects in the experimental group will receive MSCs      infusion, in addition to standardized therapy.      Subject Criteria Inclusion Criteria for MSC Donor from Umbilical Cord:      Umbilical cord is collected from elective caesarean section from a fullterm pregnancies      without any complication and free from HIV, Hepatitis B, C, D virus, Cytomegalovirus, Rubella      Virus, and free from fungal and bacterial contamination.      Informed consent all of the subjects must be filled and signed up before ruled in this study.      As soon as after delivery, the umbilical cord is collected and processed in sterile specimen      0,9% NaCl at 4oC for 8 hours. The umbilical cord transported to the laboratory and cultured      in GMP lab, at Stem Cells Medical Technology Integrated Service Unit Cipto Mangunkusumo      Hospital. Cellular viability and proliferation are evaluated after cell characterization test      by flow cytometer.      Sterility tests are done three times to ensure cellular sterility. Subjects will receive MSCs      through infusion through intravenous for 1 hour, following the administration of      diphenhydramine and anticoagulant to prevent clotting.      Following the MSCs administration, monitoring at the patients is carried out every day,      whereas laboratory testing for basic parameters (complete blood count, differential count,      blood gas analysis, C-reactive protein, SGOT/SGPT (AST/ALT), Ureum/Creatinine, eGFR,      electrolyte, procalcitonin, albumin, total bilirubin, D-Dimer, fibrinogen, troponin I and      proBNP) are carried out every three days. Cytokine levels are measured before the      administration and 7th day after the administration. Chest radiography is carried out every      three days.    ",,"

","      Idiopathic Focal Segmental Glumero Sclerosis (FSGS) is not very common but important      manifestation of kidney disease.      FSGS has poor prognosis among the patterns of Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome (INS).      Even with treatment (Steroid therapy and cytotoxic immunosuppressant therapy), many patients      eventually still require dialysis.      Cell therapy is useful in treatment of INS and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one of the      cells that useful in the treatment of glomerulus disease.      Intravenous injection of allogeneic adipose derived mesenchymal stromal/stem cell will be      done in 5 patients with refractory INS(FSGS). They will be followed 1, 2, 4 weeks and then      monthly until a year following injection day.    ","      Primary FSGS thought to be a part of the immune-mediated disease. Main challenge is to      decrease protein excretion in urine. Only 30% of children with FSGS achieve complete      remission with steroids and other 30-40% patients experience remission (partial and complete)      with cytotoxic immunosuppressant drugs. Even with these treatments, many patients eventually      still require dialysis. Other treatment strategy doesn't exceed beyond symptomatic treatment      and delaying the progression. Also risk of recurrence after kidney transplantation is 20-50%.      Cell therapy is one of the treatment strategies and mesenchymal stromal/stem cell is one      modality that notice in glomerulus disease.      We will evaluate safety and efficacy of intravenous injection of allogeneic AD-MSC      (adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cell) in 5 refractory INS patients.They will be followed      1, 2, 4 weeks and then monthly until a year following injection day.

","      This is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study that will enroll 105 subjects      with de novo anterior myocardial infarction due to a lesion of the left anterior descending      coronary artery undergoing PCI. Eligible subjects will be enrolled and undergo      revascularization of the culprit LAD followed by an intracoronary (IC) delivery of the      assigned treatment, infused into the stented culprit artery. The study will determine the      safety and feasibility of the IC infusion of investigational MPCs in this patient population.    ","      This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study that will enroll      approximately 105 subjects with de novo anterior STEMI due to a lesion involving LAD coronary      artery who undergo primary PCI at approximately 25 clinical study sites.      This study will compare two doses of MPCs and a placebo control group. Study subjects will be      randomly assigned in 1:1:1 fashion to receive either 12.5 Million or 25 Million MPCs or      placebo (saline). Each group will have approximately 35 subjects.      Potential subjects will be approached by a site investigator prior to PCI and must sign an      informed consent form before initiation of the cardiac catheterization procedure in order to      participate in this trial. Following successful and uneventful PCI and stenting of the      culprit LAD lesion, the subjects will be randomized. The randomization and treatment      assignment will be obtained from an interactive voice-response system (IVRS/interactive web      response system (IWRS)). The following stratification for duration of cardiac ischemia will      be performed to ensure balanced randomization across the treatment groups:        -  ≤2 hours        -  >2 hours to ≤6 hours        -  >6 to ≤12 hours Eligible subjects will receive intracoronary delivery of the assigned           treatment infused via a microcatheter into the stented culprit artery.      After approximately 50% of the intracoronary infusion of investigational agent has been      completed, an angiographic determination of coronary flow will be performed. The following      guidelines will be used to determine if the remaining investigational agent should be      infused:      The study infusion should be continued if either TIMI 2 or TIMI 3 flow is present in the      absence of ALL of the following;        -  Sustained hypotension not responsive to fluid administration;        -  Clinical signs/symptoms indicating an acute cerebrovascular event;        -  Re-elevation of ST-segments if previously resolved with PCI;        -  Onset of the subject's symptoms of myocardial ischemia unresponsive to appropriate           interventions;        -  Two episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF)           requiring cardioversion (infusion can continue if a single episode of sustained VT/VF           requiring cardioversion occurred).      If for any reason, the site investigator withdraws a randomized subject prior to infusion of      the investigational agent, the reason for early termination and data from the screening visit      will be entered into the eCRF by the study site. The subject will not remain in the study. If      for any reason, a subject's study infusion is halted due to safety considerations, the      subject will remain in the study. A subject who prematurely withdraws from the study, post-      study infusion will remain in the study.      Evaluation for safety will be performed for up to 24 months post infusion. Subjects will      undergo cardiac imaging (using cMRI and 2D-echocardiography), Holter monitoring, clinical      evaluations, and laboratory testing. Clinical evaluations and safety laboratory testing will      be performed post infusion of investigational agent as outlined in the study protocol.      Subjects enrolled in Sweden who consent for additional safety follow-up will be followed for      safety assessments at 36, 48, and 60 months post-infusion of investigational agent.

",      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the utility of composite wrapping      comprising human amniotic membrane and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells      (HAM-AdMSC) for augmentation of nerve transfer procedure in upper TBPI patients    ,"      Nerve transfer procedure is recognized as the current gold standard for treating traumatic      brachial plexus injury (TBPI). However, despite the current major progress in diagnosis and      microsurgical repair, the prognosis in TBPI remains unfavorable due to limited donor nerve      and compromised regenerative capability of the nervous system arising from prolonged      denervation. Therefore, there is a major need to devise new treatment strategies; and one      possible approach is to develop cellular therapies to bioengineer new nerve tissue and/or      modulate the endogenous regenerative mechanisms within the injured nerve.      Our previous studies have shown that the peripheral nerve tissue engineering approach using      human amniotic membrane seeded with allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs to augment axonal      regeneration in nerve transfer of TBPI patient revealed promising functional recovery of the      shoulder range of motion (ROM). The investigators plan a non-randomized clinical trial in a      single center to investigate the use of a hybrid (composite) between human amniotic membrane      (HAM) and allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC) as wrapping in the nerve      transfer procedure of upper TBPI patients, with a focus on the augmentation of axonal      regeneration    ",,"

Initial elbow flexion MRC grade 1 (in months)
throughout the study duration (12 months), recorded as the first time reported by the patients
Measurement of the length of time (in months) for the patients to show initial contraction (achieve MRC grade 1) of elbow flexion. Previous study by Estrella (2011) showed that the average time for brachial plexus injury patients to achieve an elbow flexion grade M3 after nerve transfer procedure was 7.6 months (range, 5-12 months). As the elbow flexion is the most important movement to restore in treating BPI, the investigators aim to compare the length of time (in months) for the patients to achieve initial contraction (MRC grade 1). The sooner the patients achieve initial elbow flexion MRC grade 1, the better the outcome is.

","      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed      cellular cardiomyoplasty, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium. Ideally, graft cells should be readily      available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and able to      survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered      cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the      surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial, and recent evidence suggests that this      may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft      cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a      number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and      neonatal cardiomyocytes, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes, tissue engineered contractile      grafts, skeletal myoblasts, several cell types derived from adult bone marrow, and cardiac      precursors residing within the heart itself. There has been substantial clinical development      in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast preparations in studies enrolling both      post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and      heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also      been studied clinically.      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority      of the trials.      Chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction resulting from heart disease is a common and      problematic condition; definitive therapy in the form of heart transplantation is available      to only a tiny minority of eligible patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart      failure has been studied less than for acute MI, but represents a potentially important      alternative for this disease.    ",,,"

","      This project aims to assess safety and efficacy of allogeneic Mesenchymal stem Cell (MSC) in      Crohn's disease refractory or intolerant to conventional therapies. Twenty patients with      active refractory Crohn's disease defined by a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) > 220      despite conventional treatment will be included over 4 years in this phase I-II trial. This      will be a pilot open label trial. Patients will be treated with 2 successive injections of      allogeneic MSC at baseline and 4 weeks later. Patients will be followed up at weeks 2, 4, 8      and 12.    ","      1. Collection and expansion of MSC Bone marrow collection and MSC expansion cultures will           be carried out at the Laboratory of Cell and Gene Therapy (LTCG) at the University of           Liège. Bone marrow (50 ml) will be collected from unrelated donors under local           anesthesia, mononuclear cells will be isolated, and cultured for a total of about 4           weeks. After a sufficient number of passages, the cells will be harvested, washed and           frozen.        2. MSC injections MSC will be thawed and diluted at the Laboratory of Cell and Gene Therapy           (LTCG), transported to the hospital ward and injected intravenously within 1 hour of           thawing through a central catheter (when available) or a good peripheral vein. A dose of           1.5 - 2.0 x 106/kg recipient MSC should be ideally administered at each infusion. MSC           will be infused even if the number of post-thaw cells is lower than that. Patients with           Crohn's disease will receive two injections of allogenic MSC 4 weeks apart (week 0 and           4).        3. Patients Follow up      3.1. Quality controls of MSC products Quality controls of MSC product will include      microscopy, nucleated cell count and differential, cell viability testing, microbiology      testing (including standard virology, bacterial culture and detection of mycoplasmal enzymes      by bioluminescence, endotoxin testing, karyotype and FACS analysis (cells must be positive      for :CD90 > 70%,CD105 > 70 %,CD73 > 70 %; and negative for :CD14 < 5%,CD34 < 5%, CD45 < 5%,      CD3 < 1%).      3.2. Toxicities of cell infusions: Potential toxicities associated with MSC infusions will be      carefully monitored per the institution's standards and documented on the infusion report      and/or the SAE report form. No dosage modifications are scheduled. In case of severe reaction      to the first MSC infusion, the second infusion will not be performed.      3.3. Clinical data The following parameters will be followed at baseline as well as at week      2, 4, 8 and 12 : CDAI level, CRP levels, fecal calprotectin levels. In addition, duration of      hospitalization, infections, any other serious complication, and eath and survival will be      recorded.      3.4. Immunologic data: Immune function in the patient will be monitored at baseline and      appropriate intervals: nucleated cell count and differential; FACS analysis with      determination of the % cells (on total WBC) with the markers :CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+,      CD45RA+, CD45RO+, CD56+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+; CD3+CD56+; CD4+CD45RA+, CD4+CD45RO+; CD3-CD56+;      regulatory T-cell (Treg) levels; immunoglobulin levels, Vβ repertoire of T lymphocytes; TRECs      quantification in T lymphocytes.

",      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)      obtained from umbilical cords for the treatment of adults with active systemic lupus      erythematosus (SLE).    ,"      This open label trial will evaluate the safety of allogeneic MSCs for the treatment of adults      with moderate to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). MSCs will be derived      from healthy donor umbilical cord cells and 1 dose of MSCs will be tested. MUSC has a good      manufacturing practice (GMP) quality Clean Cell Facility to ensure the quality and safety of      the MSCs prior to infusing into study participants. The goal of this study is to determine      the safety of MSC infusion in patients with SLE when added to standard of care for SLE.      The MSCs used in this trial are cells that are obtained from the umbilical cords of healthy      donors having an elective Caesarean section and who have been screened to be sure that they      are free of any infectious diseases. These investigational cells will be collected and      processed so that they can be used as an infusion treatment. An infusion is when a drug (in      this case the MSCs) is administered directly into the blood stream via a vein, usually      located in the arm or hand. All participants will receive standard of care and their safety      will be monitored throughout the study.    ",,"

",      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of tissue engineered construct      based on allogeneic cultured adipose-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells      (ALLO-ADSCs) and platelet-poor plasma fibrin hydrogel to treat patients with 2-B and 3-      degree burn wounds    ,"      For more than 20 years in clinical practice allogeneic transplantation of diploid fibroblasts      (ADP) for burn wounds has been successfully used, it is used as an independent method, and a      method of preparing wounds for autologous skin grafting [1].      The clinical efficacy of transplantation ADP, after the research done by E.V. Glushchenko;      Rahayev AM [2,3] is not doubted.      Several studies have shown the efficacy of stem cells in promoting faster and superior wound      healing. Alexaki [4] successfully used adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells in wound      healing in mice and compared their effect with dermal fibroblasts. The application of stem      cells in wounds promoted more efficient reepithelialization by their proliferative effect on      keratinocytes.      In recent years, the world's leading burn centers attempted to restore the skin over large      areas of burn wounds by epidermal layers transplantation of allogeneic cells cultured in      culture medium.      The information expected in the study will be based on the principles of evidence-based      medicine and will have practical significance for the treatment of burn wounds.      It is expected to show a positive effect of cultured multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells in      the epithelization of burn wounds process as well as the extent and speed healing of skin      flap during autologous skin grafting.

",      To assess whether intravenously administered third-party bone marrow-derived mesenchymal      stromal cells (MSCs) are safe and have an impact on disease severity in RDEB    ,"      This is a phase I/II clinical trial with a key objective of evaluating safety of third party      bone MSCs intravenous infusions in 10 adults with the inherited severe skin fragility      disorder, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). The main objectives of our study      are to: (1) to assess the spectrum of clinical responses in adults with RDEB receiving      intravenous MSCs; (2) to identify the best cohort of individuals to target for future trials      and therapies; (3) to improve our understanding of in vivo and in vitro responsiveness to      MSCs; (4) to identify candidate molecules germane to activating MSCs and making them      clinically more potent, independently of the permissive conditions of the patient and (5) to      assess its impact on reducing disease morbidity/severity in this population.      This is a prospective, non-randomised, open label study. All study participants will receive      two intravenous MSC infusions at baseline Day 0 and Day 14 and will be followed up for a 12      month period following the first infusion. Each subject will undergo an initial screening      including physical examination, assessment of vital signs and disease severity assessment.    ",,"

Most of such patients die before      the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an      effective treatment for that. Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may      help to overcome the shortage of donor organs. There have been reports of successful      treatment of different kinds of metabolic liver disorders by hepatocyte transplantation. The      major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of hepatocytes is very      limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes. In the in-vitro      culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into      hepatocytes has been documented.

Most of such patients die before      the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an      effective treatment and can decrease their serum cholesterol to near normal levels (Bilheimer      DW, N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1658-64). Shortage of donor organ is a major problem for OLT.      Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of      donor organ. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic      liver disorders (such as Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Fox IJ, et al.

Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes.      Although, in the in-vivo system there is a controversy that if stem cells transdifferentiate      into hepatocytes or fusion of stem cells and hepatocytes occur, however, in the in-vitro      culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into      hepatocytes has been documented (Lee KD, et al.

","      Crohn's disease has several phenotypes (inflammatory, stricturing, fistulizing) and location      (small bowel, ileocecal, colon, and perianal). Approximately one third of patients have      inflammation limited to the colon. Up to two thirds will become medically refractory and      require a total abdominal colectomy for symptom control. The purpose of this study is to      determine the safety and efficacy of using allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem      cells (MSCs) delivered by targeted endoscopic delivery to treat people for medically      refractory Crohn's colitis.    ","      Participants with medically refractory Crohn's colitis will be treated by targeted endoscopic      delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected into the      submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.      Patients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs      (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical      remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients      observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will      proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control      patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be      retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.      There will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150      million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control)      receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24      participants.

","      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of using remestemcel-L, an      ex vivo culture-expanded adult allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell product      (MSCs) delivered by targeted endoscopic delivery to treat people for medically refractory      ulcerative colitis.      This study will enroll adult patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis who are      planning to switch biologic therapy or undergo colectomy as the next stage in their treatment      plan.    ","      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory disease of the colon and      rectum, which continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons, resulting in a      significant burden to the healthcare system. UC is characterized by persistent mucosal      inflammation of the colon and rectum with a chronic remitting and relapsing behavior which      leaves patients on chronic immunosuppression and hospitalizations to treat the disease      symptoms, but unable to cure the disease. Despite the ever-growing armamentarium of      immunosuppressive medication, up to 30% of patients still require a colectomy for medically      refractory disease.      Participants with medically refractory ulcerative colitis will be treated by targeted      endoscopic delivery of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow      derived mesenchymal stem cell product at a dose of 150 or 300 million. This will be injected      into the submucosal layer of the colon and rectal wall.      Patients will receive a second dose of remestemcel-L at a dose of 150 or 300 million MSCs      (same dose as initial). If at 3 months post injection of remestemcel-L there is clinical      remission, escalation of medical management and/or surgery will be delayed and patients      observed. If there is worsening or no improvement in treated patients, then patients will      proceed with escalation of medical management or colectomy as per standard of care. Control      patients without improvement will cross over to receive remestemcel-L at 3 months and may be      retreated at 6 months. All patients will be followed for two years post initial treatment.      There will be a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control) receiving the 150      million MSC dose of study drug and a total of 4 cohorts of 3 patients (2 treatment:1 control)      receiving 300 million MSCs dose of study drug. This study plans to enroll a total of 24      participants.      The primary endpoint of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of endoscopic      injection of remestemcel-L, an ex vivo culture expanded allogeneic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cell product for treatment of medically refractory ulcerative colitis.

","      The technique of transplanting progenitor cells into a region of damaged myocardium, termed      cellular cardiomyoplasty1, is a potentially new therapeutic modality designed to replace or      repair necrotic, scarred, or dysfunctional myocardium2-4. Ideally, graft cells should be      readily available, easy to culture to ensure adequate quantities for transplantation, and      able to survive in host myocardium; often a hostile environment of limited blood supply and      immunorejection. Whether effective cellular regenerative strategies require that administered      cells differentiate into adult cardiomyocytes and couple electromechanically with the      surrounding myocardium is increasingly controversial and recent evidence suggests that this      may not be required for effective cardiac repair. Most importantly, transplantation of graft      cells should improve cardiac function and prevent adverse ventricular remodeling. To date, a      number of candidate cells have been transplanted in experimental models, including fetal and      neonatal cardiomyocytes5, embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6, 7, tissue engineered      contractile grafts8, skeletal myoblasts9, several cell types derived from adult bone      marrow10-15, and cardiac precursors residing within the heart itself16. There has been      substantial clinical development in the use of whole bone marrow and skeletal myoblast      preparations in studies enrolling both post-infarction patients, and patients with chronic      ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure. The effects of bone-marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have also been studied clinically.      Currently, bone marrow or bone marrow-derived cells represent highly promising modality for      cardiac repair. The totality of evidence from trials investigating autologous whole bone      marrow infusions into patients following myocardial infarction supports the safety of this      approach. In terms of efficacy, increases in ejection fraction are reported in the majority      of the trials.      Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is a common and problematic condition; definitive therapy      in the form of heart transplantation is available to only a tiny minority of eligible      patients. Cellular cardiomyoplasty for chronic heart failure has been studied less than for      acute MI, but represents a potentially important alternative for this disease.    ","      This is a Pilot Study, intended as a safety assessment prior to a full comparator study. In      this Pilot Study, cells administered via the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA injection catheter      system will be tested in 36 patients in two groups:      Group 1 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Auto-hMSCs: 20 million      cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108      (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.      Group 2 (18 patients) Eighteen (18) patients will be treated with Allo-hMSCs: 20 million      cells/ml delivered in a dose of 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injections for a total of 1 X 108      (100 million) Auto-hMSCs.      The first three (3) patients in each group (Group 1 and Group 2) will not be treated less      than 5 days apart and will each undergo full evaluation for 5 days to demonstrate there is no      evidence of a procedure induced myocardial infarction or myocardial perforation prior to      proceeding with the treatment of further patients.      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups.      Treatment Strategies: Autologous hMSCs vs. Allogeneic hMSCs. The Study Team will record and      maintain a detailed record of injection locations.      If a patient is randomized to Groups 1 (Auto-hMSCs) and the Auto-hMSCs do not expand to the      required dose of 1 X 108 cells, each injection will contain the maximum number of cells      available.      The injections will be administered transendocardially during cardiac catheterization using      the Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Catheter System.      For patients randomized to Group 1(Auto-hMSCs); the cells will be derived from a sample of      the patient's bone marrow (obtained by iliac crest aspiration) approximately 4-6 weeks prior      to cardiac catheterization. For patients randomized to Group 2 (Allo- hMSCs), the cells will      be supplied from an allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source manufactured by the      University of Miami. The Allo-hMSCs for patients in group 2 will be administered after all      baseline assessments are completed with an expected range of 2 - 4 weeks post-randomization.      Following cardiac catheterization and cell injections, patients will be hospitalized for a      minimum of 2 days then followed at 2 weeks post-catheterization, and at month 2, 3, 6, and 12      to complete all safety and efficacy assessments.

","      This is an interventional, single arm, multicenter, phase I/IIa clinical trial. The study      objective is to investigate the efficacy and safety of three i.v. doses of the      investigational medicinal product (IMP) allo-APZ2-ACLF for the treatment of acute-on-chronic      liver failure (ACLF). The allogeneic IMP allo-APZ2-ACLF contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive      mesenchymal stem cells isolated from skin tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell      bank.    ","      This is an interventional, phase I/IIa clinical trial to investigate the efficacy (by changes      in Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score) and safety (by monitoring adverse events)      of the IMP in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure grade 2 and 3. The allogeneic IMP      allo-APZ2-ACLF contains skin-derived ABCB5-positive mesenchymal stem cells isolated from skin      tissue of healthy donors and stored in a donor cell bank.      The clinical trial will be conducted in Germany and will consist of a screening, treatment      and efficacy follow-up period, and a safety follow-up period.The total duration is planned to      be about 3 years including the follow-up period.      The planned sample size is up to 18 treated patients. 2 x 10e6 cells/kg, each at Day 0, Day 5      (±1) and Day 13 (±1), will be administrated into peripheral vein (arm) by use of a perfusor.      allo-APZ2-ACLF will be in a concentration of 1 x 10e7 cells/mL in HRG-solution. In patients      which require dialysis, the IMP application has to be performed at least 3 hours after end of      dialysis. This is necessary to ensure that cells and secreted molecules are not cleared from      the system by the dialysis.      Patients will be followed up for 24 weeks with clinic visits at Weeks 3, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and      24 after IMP application. Further safety follow-ups will be scheduled as home interviews via      telephone at Months 15 and 24. If necessary (at the discretion of the investigator), safety      follow-ups at Months 15 and 24 can also be carried out as an on-site visit.      The first six patients will be enrolled into the clinical trial consecutively with an      interval of 2 weeks between the third IMP-application of the first patient and the enrolment      of the second patient, etc. During this period the patient receives all three applications      and immediate severe adverse effects (allergic reactions, SIRS) that could occur after      treatment would be reported before treatment start of the next patient.      The safety data of these first six patients will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor      continuously, if required with assistance of the further members of the DSMB. The safety      evaluation of the DSMB will be submitted to the PEI and recruitment can only be continued      after approval of an amendment.    ","

","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been shown to have immunosuppressive properties. Following      a bone marrow/peripheral blood stem cell transplant, a proportion of patients develop a      condition called 'graft versus host disease' (GVHD). In this condition the transplanted cells      recognize the recipient as foreign and bring about an immune-mediated destruction of tissues.      The treatment for this condition is to use drugs that will cause immunosuppression. A small      subset of these patients develop a severe form of GVHD (Grade III or IV) which, in spite of      the best currently available treatment, is associated with eventual death in more than 90% of      cases. The investigators propose to use infusions of expanded MSC from the donor to treat      this condition. A few reports on this approach have already been published in peer reviewed      journals and preliminary results appear to be promising. The investigators are also aware      that larger trials have been initiated to study this. After getting written informed consent,      the investigators will infuse expanded MSC into patients who develop steroid-resistant GVHD.    ","      A single center non randomized, non blinded Phase I/II clinical trial is proposed to study      the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in the management of steroid refractory graft versus      host disease (GVHD) following an allogeneic stem cell transplant.      Patients who develop grade II to IV GVHD following an allogeneic stem cell transplant will be      enrolled. MSC will be expanded from the donors of all patients who develop GVHD. Expanded MSC      will be infused at a dose of 1-2 million cells/kg in patients who have steroid refractory      GVHD.      Response to therapy will be studied using established criteria for grading GVHD.    ",,"

","      To investigate safety of treatment with allogeneic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal      cells (ASCs) in patients undergoing lung transplantation, to evaluate whether the treatment      can reduce host immunological reaction towards the graft, and to reduce the ischemic      reperfusion-injury after transplantation.    ","      The emerging field of stem cell therapy holds promise of treating a variety of diseases.      Especially the mesenchymal stromal cells from bone marrow (BMSCs) or adipose tissue (ASCs)      have proven their potential for regenerative therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease.      Both of these cell types have putative immunomodulatory properties, as they have demonstrated      to actively suppress the immune system and hereby evade recognition.      This knowledge will be transferred into studies in the ischemic reperfusion-injury/primary      lung graft dysfunction in lung transplantation, and in suppressing the initial host      immunological response towards the transplanted lung where a high degree of immunological and      inflammatory activity is involved.      We will conduct a clinical trial in which patients receiving lung transplantation will be      randomized to either placebo or treatment with allogeneic MSCs from adipose tissue. The aim      is to assess the impact of MSCs on primary graft dysfunction.      The perspective is that this new information can be of pivotal importance and potentially be      a paradigm shift for the clinical problems seen in the first period after lung      transplantation and reduce the long-term graft rejection and dysfunction.

","      Ulcerative colitis is a form of inflammatory bowel disease characterized by diffuse      inflammation of the colonic mucosa. It affects the rectum and extends proximally along a      variable length of the colon. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic condition with a relapsing      remitting course. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a subset of adult stem cells residing in      many tissues, including bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, umbilical cord blood. Recent      experimental findings have shown the ability of MSCs to home to damaged tissues and to      produce paracrine factors with anti-inflammatory properties, potentially resulting in      reduction of inflammation and functional recovery of the damaged tissues. The purpose of our      study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of the intracolonic injection by using a colonoscope      of allogeneic adipose MSCs in patients with moderate active ulcerative colitis.

Histologic Evaluation of Ulcerative Colitis
Baseline, 8 weeks
A 10 to 20 centimeter (cm) biopsy sample of inflamed mucosal tissue was taken from the worst affected area and scored using the Riley Index. The Riley Index is a histologic scoring system for the assessment of the activity and severity of ulcerative colitis, ranging from 0 to 24. It consists of 6 histologic features (acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt abscesses, mucin depletion, surface epithelial integrity, chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate, and crypt architectural irregularities), all scored on a 4-point scale (higher scores indicate more severe disease).

","      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of treating patients experiencing poor      graft function after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with Granulocyte      Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral stem cell combined (PBSC) with      ex-vivo-expanded BM-drived mesenchymal stem cells from third-party donors. Our first      objective was to evaluate the effect of such treatment on poor graft function, and second      object was to investigate the safety of such treatment.    ","      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many      hematologic diseases. However, poor graft function (PGF) is an important complication after      allo-HSCT that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable mortality      related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually involves the      prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor      (G-CSF), or second transplantation, but these methods are associated with dismal effect or      even a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs      include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host      disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or      cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs      might be effective in the treatment of PGF.      However, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF is unsatisfactory in our      previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used combined      with MSCs in the patients with PGF after allo-HSCT.    ",,"

",      Assessment of the clinical effects of infusions of cryopreserved allogeneic multipotent      mesenchymal stem cells of the placenta and umbilical cord for COVID-19 patients with acute      respiratory distress syndrome.    ,"      Currently, cell-based therapy and especially stem cell therapy has become a promising      therapeutic field, in which many see opportunities to cure incurable diseases. Severe      respiratory consequences of the COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2      coronavirus, have prompted urgent need for novel therapies.      Cell-based approaches, primarily using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have demonstrated      safety and efficacy in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) - common      manifestation of cytokine storms, and the cause of death in many COVID-19 patients.      Mesenchymal stem cells are a powerful immunomodulator, they secrete many anti-inflammatory      biologically active substances (cytokines) that reduce the inflammatory process in the lungs.      Also mesenchymal stem cells secrete numerous growth factors that contribute to the recovery      of not only the affected lung tissue but also other organs.    ",,"

","      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus infectious disease characterized by acute respiratory      impairment due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) broke out in      Wuhan city of Hubei province in China. So far no specific antiviral therapy can be available      for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care, even with      mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are strongly      recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such      as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes. This pilot      clinical trial will be performed to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation      of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in severe      patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).    ","      Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 infection has become a worldwide urgent public health event,      especially in China. As of February 13, 2020, over 63,000 cases have been confirmed with over      10,200 severe cases in mainland of China. There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral      treatment existing for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although symptomatic and supportive care are      recommended for severe infected individuals, those with advancing age and co-morbidities such      as diabetes and heart disease remain to be at high risk for adverse outcomes, with mortality      of ~10%. Therefore, it is urgent to find a safe and effective therapeutic approach to      patients with severe coronavirus disease-19(COVID-19) characterized by an severe acute      respiratory impairment.      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) or their exosomes      (MSCs-Exo) significantly reduced lung inflammation and pathological impairment resulting from      different types of lung injury. In addition, macrophage phagocytosis, bacterial killing and      outcome are improved. It is highly likely that MSCs-Exo have the same therapeutic effect on      inoculation pneumonia as MSCs themselves.      Although human bone marrow MSCs have been safely administered in patients with ARDS and      septic shock (phase I/II trials), it seems safer to deliver MSCs-Exo rather than live MSCs.      The intravenous administration of MSCs may result in aggregating or clumping in the injured      microcirculation and carries the risk of mutagenicity and oncogenicity, which do not exist by      treating with nebulized MSCs-Exo. Another advantage of MSCs-Exo over MSCs is the possibility      of storing them for several weeks/months allowing their safe transportation and delayed      therapeutic use.      The purpose of this single-arm design, open label, combined interventional clinical trial,      therefore, is to explore the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of the exosomes      derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-Exo) in the treatment of severe      patients hospitalized with novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP).

CD also causes bowel      wall ulcers, strictures and fistulas (abnormal passages from the intestines to another organ      or the skin).      There is an unmet need for effective medical therapy in CD patients with perianal fistulas,      not responding to the conventional strategies, including biological therapies. The current      study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Allogeneic Umbilical Cord-derived      Mesenchymal Stem cells from healthy donors for the treatment of perianal fistulas in patients      presenting CD.

","      The present project aims at evaluating the capacity of MSC to improve one-year overall      survival of patients transplanted with HLA-mismatched PBSC from related or unrelated donors      after non-myeloablative conditioning.      Co-infusion of MSC has been shown to facilitate engraftment of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)      in an immunodeficient mouse model. In addition, it has been shown that infusion of third      party MSC in HSC transplantation could be successfully used as treatment for grade II-IV      steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease.      One hundred and twenty patients with HLA-mismatched donors will be included over 6 years at      multiple centers across Belgium through the transplant committee of the Belgian Hematological      Society. The conditioning regimen will consist of fludarabine and 2 Gy TBI, followed by the      infusion of donor HSC. Patients will be randomized 1/1 in double-blind fashion to receive or      not MSC (1.5-.3.0 x106/kg) from third-party (either haploidentical family members or      unrelated volunteer) donors on day 0. Postgrafting immunosuppression will combine tacrolimus      and MMF. Except for the collection, expansion and infusion of MSC, the clinical management of      the patient will not differ from that of routine NM-HCT.    ",,"

","      This project is to determine the safety and explore the effectiveness of allogeneic (not      cells of the participant but those of another human) mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in      decreasing inflammation and possible enlargement of the participants' abdominal aortic      aneurysm. Participants will be selected as a possible subject because of an abdominal aortic      aneurysm discovered on the ultrasound or computed tomographic (""CT"") scan requested by the      participants' doctor.      The purpose of this study is to collect information that will be used to determine if MSCs      can be used to decrease inflammation and possibly slow down enlargement of the participants'      aneurysm. The investigators will also be collecting blood samples to study special      inflammatory cells that cause aneurysms as well as asking participants to have a ""PET""      (positron emission tomography) scan that can measure inflammation directly in the      participants' aneurysm.    ","      This is a phase I, double blinded trial that will enroll 50 patients with Abdominal Aortic      Aneurysms (AAA) measuring 3-5 cm in maximal transverse diameter (MTD). This study will assess      the safety of MSCs in doses of 1 million MSCs/kg. or 3 million MSCs/kg. delivered      intra-venously. This trial test the hypothesis that MSCs, in a dose dependent fashion,      promote the frequency and immune suppressor function of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T-regulatory cells      and decrease AAA inflammation as measured by 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). The primary safety endpoints will be incidence of      treatment related adverse events accrued over 24 months. Efficacy measures are changes in      frequency and immune suppressor function of Tregs, number and cytotoxic activity of CD4+/CD8+      CD28- T-cells, activated monocytes, and changes in aortic inflammation as measured by uptake      of 18-FDG PET/CT compared to baseline. Incidence of surgical intervention, aneurysm related      death, quality of life, and major adverse cardiac events will be recorded.    ","

","      A phase II open-label, single arm study aimed to ascertain whether infusions of cord-blood      mesenchymal stromal cells (CB-MSCs) allow to reduce or suspend the chronic immunosuppressive      therapy (IS) in steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS).      We plan to enroll 11 patients aged 3 to 18 with SDNS in remission for at least one month,      maintained by either ≥2 immunosuppressive drugs or a calcineurin inhibitor.      Patients are infused with cord-blood allogenic MSC, selected by in-vitro alloreactivity, at a      dose of 1.5x10^6/kg on days 0, 14, 21. The immunosuppressive treatment is gradually tapered      starting at the first CB-MSC administration, according to the following scheme: 25% following      the first administration, 50% following the second administration, and 100% reduction      following the third administration.      All patients will be followed-up for 6 months from the last CB-MSC. Study visits are planned      at baseline during CB-MSC administrations, 2 weeks (follow-up [FU]1) and 6 weeks (FU2) after      the last infusion, and then every 6 weeks. During follow-up, the patients undergo a physical      examination (including measurement of height, weight and blood pressure) and laboratory      evaluations (urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio, complete blood count, kidney function,      plasma proteins, liver function, triglycerides and cholesterol). In addition, a blood sample      is taken for regulatory T lymphocyte quantification, a marker of clinical response to the      infusions.    ","      Background:      Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare disease characterized by nephrotic-range proteinuria and      the need for steroid treatment. About 50% of children will become frequent relapsers (FRNS)      or steroid dependent (SDNS), requiring higher doses of steroids or other immunosuppressive      drugs for many years, sometimes up to adulthood. Strong evidence suggests that Idiopathic      nephrotic syndrome (INS), at least in the steroid-sensitive forms, has an immune      pathogenesis.      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC) are multipotent non-hematopoietic stem cells that produce an      immunomodulatory activity in-vitro and in-vivo. For this reason, we postulated that SDNS      patients could benefit with treatment with MSC.      Objectives:      The main goal of the present study is to assess whether CB-MSCs have the capacity to regulate      the immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of NS allowing for a reduction or      suspension of chronic immunosuppressive treatment in SDNS children. The primary objective is      to evaluate whether CB-MSC therapy is able to prevent NS recurrence for at least 6 months      after complete withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment in children with SDNS.      Primary endpoint: percentage of children without NS recurrence after complete withdrawal of      immunosuppressive treatment for at least 6 months.      Population:      We plan to enroll 11 children (3 to 18 years of age) with SDNS, maintained by chronic      immunosuppressive treatment and with stable remission for at least two months.      Study Design:      Open label single-arm, monocentric trial, with a rescue/second design      Phase: Phase II      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:      Inclusion criteria        1. Age between 3 and 18 years;        2. Clinical diagnosis of SDNS;        3. Disease remission maintained by chronic therapy (at least 6 months) with either:             -  Use of a combination of 2 or more immunosuppressive drugs             -  use of 1 of the calcineurin inhibitors (Cyclosporin or Tacrolimus);        4. Absence of proteinuria (urinary protein:urinary creatinine < 0.2 mg/mg) for at least 1           month;        5. Estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than or equal to 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;        6. Written informed consent from parents or guardians and the child when possible.      Exclusion criteria        1. Age < 3 years or ≥ 19 years;        2. Resistant/refractory NS;        3. Presence of genetic mutations associated with NS;        4. eGFR less than 70 ml/min/1.73 m^2;        5. Thrombophilic condition;        6. Pregnancy or lactating;        7. Evidence of an uncooperative attitude;        8. Any evidence that the patient will be unable to complete the trial follow-up.      Description of the Intervention:      The trial will rely on a single advanced therapy medicinal product (ATMP), made by MSC from      umbilical cord blood (CB) for allogeneic use, produced following a highly standardized      process, developed and controlled at Cell Factory under the Good Manufacturing Practices      guidelines.      After baseline clinical and laboratory evaluation, patients will receive 3 intravenous      infusions of CB-MSCs at the dosage of 1.5 x 10^6/kg at a time interval of 1 to 2 weeks.      The immunosuppressive treatment will be gradually tapered off following the first CB-MSC      administration: 25%, 50% and 100% reduction of the ongoing immunosuppressive treatment      following the first, second and third administration, respectively.      At the end of this first part of the trial, a statistical analysis will be performed      according to the primary end-point. In the case of failure to reach the primary end point an      extra 11 children with SDNS will be enrolled in a single stage phase 2 study with a 30%      incremented dose of CB-MSCs.      Statistical Evaluation:      A phase II design with a rescue plan B, is adopted to decide whether the proportion      responding is less than or equal to 0.200 or greater than or equal to 0.600. A sample size of      10 children is required, considering a drop out of 10%, 11 children will be enrolled: if the      number of responses is 5 or more, the hypothesis that P ≤ 0.200 is rejected with a target      error rate of 5%. If the number of responses is 4 or less, the hypothesis that P ≥ 0.600 is      rejected with a target error rate of 20% (power equal to 80%). The same statistical      hypothesis will apply for the second part of the study.      Expected Results:      The results of this proposal will provide information regarding an innovative cell therapy      for the treatment of INS. If the hypothesis of this study is confirmed, it will be possible      to reduce or withdraw immunosuppressive treatment in this vulnerable population of children      with SDNS, reducing the need for ambulatory visits and hospitalization and therapy-related      complications. Furthermore, the reduction in the use of immunosuppressive agents as well as      in the number of outpatient visits and hospital admissions will reduce the financial burden      to the National Health Service. Above all, the quality of life of children with SDNS would      clearly be improved, in terms of a reduction in long-term therapy, morbidity and the number      of visits.    ",,"

",      Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Exosomes Derived from Allogenic Adipose Mesenchymal Stem      Cells（MSCs-Exos）in Subjects with Alzheimer's disease.    ,"      To date, the main pathological characteristics of AD patients are the accumulation of      β-amyloid (Aβ) into senile plaques, the abnormal aggregation of intracellular Tau protein to      form neuron fiber tangles (NFT) and neuron death. There are still no effective treatments to      prevent, halt, or reverse Alzheimer's disease.      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes. These      vesicles have a content that includes cytokines and growth factors, signaling lipids, mRNAs,      and regulatory miRNAs. Exosomes are involved in cell-to-cell communication, cell signaling,      and altering cell or tissue metabolism at short or long distances in the body, and can      influence tissue responses to injury, infection, and disease.      The purpose of this single center, open label, phase I/Ⅱ clinical trial, therefore, is to      explore the safety and efficacy of the exosomes derived from allogenic adipose mesenchymal      stem cells (MSCs-Exos) in the treatment of mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's      Disease.

Those      patients randomized to the experimental arm will receive mesenchymal precursor cells (MPCs)      injected directly into the LV endocardium during their LV recruitment or BDG procedure. Those      patients randomized to the control arm will receive normal standard of care during their      procedure with no injection of MPCs.      It is believed that injection of MPCs will help improve the chances of those patients with      single ventricle or borderline left ventricle being converted to biventricular circulation      which could improve quality of life and longevity over palliation.    ","      This is a prospective, single center, safety and feasibility, blinded, randomized trial to      evaluate the use of MPCs in children with complex cardiac anatomy requiring surgical repair.      Patients scheduled to undergo bidirectional Glenn (BDG) with future plans for LV recruitment,      or patients with a history of BDG who are currently scheduled to undergo LV recruitment will      be eligible.      Twenty-four subjects will be enrolled, 12 to the MPC treatment arm and 12 to the control arm      following a 1:1 randomization schema. Randomization will be stratified according to surgeon      to assure random distribution of subjects by surgeon. Families, the biostatistician, all      clinical staff outside the operating room, and research staff completing data analysis will      be blinded to randomization assignment. The PI, operating room staff, and research staff      assisting with delivery will be unblinded to the randomization assignment. Families will be      made aware of their randomization assignment once all subjects have completed their study      Visit 4. Those randomized to the treatment arm will receive MPCs injected directly into the      LV endocardium following clinical surgical maneuvers to recruit the LV (mitral valve repair,      aortic valve repair, and/or resection of endocardial fibroelastosis) or BDG. Those subjects      randomized to the control arm will receive standard LV recruitment or BDG with no injection.      All cardiac tissue acquired as part of a clinically indicated procedure will be collected on      enrolled subjects. Most of the tissue sample will be analyzed at the time of collection      (histology and H+E stain); the remainder will be banked for potential future testing.    ",,"

","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in a variety of clinical applications to repair      and regenerate damaged tissue. Previous research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of      delivering bone marrow cells including MSCs to chronic wounds with significant improvement in      healing and scarring. Application of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to severe burn      wounds represents an opportunity for improved outcomes where alternate therapies are limited      and often ineffective.      In this protocol, 2nd degree burn wounds will receive direct application of EVs derived from      bone marrow MSCs. We have observed success with this type of approach in the past using bone      marrow stem cells including MSCs. We have evidence that EVs derived from MSCs are responsible      for many of the healing effects produced by MSCs and may be a safer, more reliable      alternative to allogeneic cell therapy. This protocol is designed to develop a safe and ideal      method of administering bone marrow cell Extracellular Vesicles to wounds.    ","      The study is designed to examine the safety of administering EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs      to 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% TBSA. The study will consist of a single dose      level which will evaluate the safety of administering allogeneic Extracellular Vesicles-with      a total of 10 patients. The chosen dosage will correlate to a dose of MSCs administered under      another protocol (IND 14810). The dose level delivered will be EVs derived from approximately      1 X 104 MSCs for each cm2 treated area not to exceed 20% TBSA in total (cumulative, if more      than one area is treated). The limitation in wound sizes to be treated will not change      throughout the study. Up to 2 additional administrations of EVs will be given over a period      of no more than 8 weeks.

",,"      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of allogeneic bone      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on chronic antibody-mediated rejection (cAMR)      after kidney transplantation. Chronic AMR is diagnosed according to Banff criteria 2013 based      on renal graft biopsy and donor specific antibodies (DSA) examination. cAMR patients are      assigned to MSCs group or control group. Patients in control group are prescribed to current      desensitization therapy including at least one of the following treatments: plasmapheresis      (PP), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), rituximab or Bortezomib, depending on individual      pathological and immunological features (eg. DSA type and titer) of each study subjects.      Patients in MSCs group receive additional BM-MSCs therapy besides desensitization treatments      as in control group. Allogeneic BM-MSCs (1*10^6/kg) are intravenously administered every two      weeks for four consecutive doses. All cAMR patients are followed up for one year. Renal      function, DSA level, pathological features, patient/graft survival, and severe adverse events      are monitored during the follow-up period. Immunological features of patients in both groups      are consecutively examined.    ",,,"

",      To evaluate allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (hMSC-Exos) in the treatment of      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)    ,"      According to the 2012 Berlin diagnostic criteria, there are currently more than 3 million      ARDS patients worldwide, accounting for about 10% of patients in the intensive care unit      (ICU). In recent years, the incidence of ARDS has increased significantly, which has      significantly increased the social and economic burden. The impact of ARDS can even be      compared with tumors, AIDS or myocardial infarction. There are the basic clinical treatments,      such as using various ventilation methods to improve hypoxia and choosing alternative      therapies to improve renal insufficiency. Therefore, there is still a lack of specific      treatment measures.      Exosomes are naturally occurring nanosized vesicles and comprised of natural lipid bilayers      with the abundance of adhesive proteins that readily interact with cellular membranes.      Studies have confirmed that MSC-Exos can improve most of the pathological changes caused by      lung infection, reduce pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, reduce alveolar      inflammation, and clear bacterial infections. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of      ARDS.      The purpose of this study is to evaluate allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell exosomes      (hMSC-Exos) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)    ",,"

",      Evaluate the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment with pulmonary infection caused by      gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems.    ,"      Pulmonary infection is a critical disease threatening human health. With the extensive use of      antibiotics, the incidence of clinical drug resistance has been on the rise significantly in      recent years. Once drug resistance occurs, we will see a high mortality rate due to scarce      therapies and a poor prognosis. It is almost impossible to surmount the severe pulmonary      infection caused by drug-resistant bacteria only by upgrading antibiotics. The commonly used      supportive therapies clinically, such as glucocorticoids and immunomodulators, also lack      forceful medical evidence. Therefore, it is urgent to explore new treatments.      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.      Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cell exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted by mesenchymal      stem/progenitor cells under certain conditions, which contain a lot of proteins, lipids and      nucleic acids with tissue repair and immunomodulatory functions.      Currently, it has been confirmed that stem cells can visibly improve the pathological changes      of lungs caused by infection, lighten pulmonary edema, reduce protein exudation, mitigate      alveolar inflammation, and remove bacteria. Thus, it brings new hope for the treatment of      pulmonary infection caused by extensively drug-resistant bacteria.      Patients were treated, in the research project, with well-suited noninvasive haMPC-Exos      aerosol inhalation, in an attempt to verify the efficacy and safety of haMPC-Exos treatment      with pulmonary infection caused by gram-negative bacilli resistant to carbapenems.

",      This randomized pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of donor bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells in controlling heart failure in patients with cardiomyopathy caused by      anthracyclines. Donor bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells may help to control symptoms      of heart failure and improve heart function.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To demonstrate the safety of allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) administered      by intravenous infusion and transendocardial injection in patients with left ventricular (LV)      dysfunction and heart failure secondary to chemotherapy with anthracyclines.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To demonstrate the efficacy of allogeneic hMSCs administered by intravenous infusion and      transendocardial injection in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular      ejection fraction [LVEF] < 40%) and heart failure secondary to treatment with anthracyclines.      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.      ARM I: Patients receive hMSCs intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on days 1, 14, 21, and 28      and standard of care treatment for heart failure in the absence of disease progression or      unacceptable toxicity.

","      The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in the Western World, including Denmark.      Cancer of the head and neck and its treatment often have a detrimental and lifelong impact on      the quality of life of the patients. Radiotherapy is a key component for approximately 80% of      all patients with head and neck cancer and despite the enormous improvement in ionizing      radiotherapy, the radiation still leads to significant ionizing of healthy tissue, including      the radiation-sensitive salivary glands. Salivary glands suffer severe damage from radiation,      and as these cells are the principal sites of fluid secretion one of the most prevalent side      effect of irradiation for head and neck cancer is hyposalivation and dry mouth syndrome,      xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to debilitating oral disorders and major implication for the      overall quality of life, including social life and professional life. Currently, only      symptomatic treatment is available to patients suffering from xerostomia, and therefore there      is an immense, unmet need for new treatment strategies for hyposalivation and xerostomia.      Stem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of      disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types, and stem cells      have been suggested as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after      radiotherapy damage.      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of stem cells      from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in      previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a      clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from      xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since      only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of      xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.    ","      Background:      Xerostomia is the diagnosis of the subjective feeling of dry mouth. Xerostomia can coexist      with or exist without a reduced production of saliva, although xerostomia is first perceived      when unstimulated whole saliva flow rate is reduced by more than 40-50%. In this context, a      subnormal or pathologically reduced saliva production (hyposalivation) will severely diminish      the quality of life and lead to severe dental decay. The two main causes of grave xerostomia      are Sjögren's syndrome and radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Radiation therapy      plays a central role in the curative treatment of most upper head and neck cancers, either as      a single modality or in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery, and the prevalence of      xerostomia after head and neck radiation ranges from 74 to 85%.      Radiation therapy increases local tumor control significantly along with the chance of      survival, but despite the more advanced methods of radiation therapy, Intensity-Modulated      radiation therapy (IMRT), a significant proportion of the radiation is deposited in the      healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. The decrease of saliva secretion after radiation      therapy predisposes the patients to a variety of conditions. These are either directly or      indirectly a result of the decreased production of saliva and include xerostomia, impairment      of the normal oral functions (talking, chewing, and swallowing) due to insufficient wetting,      and reduced lubrication of mucosal surfaces and the ingested food which impairs nutrition.      Furthermore, the oral mucosa can become dry, making the oral mucosa vulnerable, which may      lead to frictional trauma and ulceration. In addition, a reduced salivary flow results in a      reduced ""rinsing"" of the entire oral cavity, thus leading to microbial overgrowth, which in      addition to other factors may result in rapid dental decay, dental erosion, and oral      candidiasis (thrush).      Stem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of      disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types. For more than      ten years, researchers have investigated the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an      approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage and several      groups have addressed the use of MSCs or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in      preclinical studies of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.      The research group has completed an encouraging randomized-controlled pilot study (MESRIX-I)      with 30 patients assessing the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded autologous ASCs for      radiation-induced xerostomia in an effort to regenerate the function of the salivary glands      (EudraCT nb:2014-004349-29). The results of this study show most importantly that the      treatment is safe without any serious adverse events (SAE) and no systemic reactions, and      secondly, the patients treated with stem cells have a promising enhanced production of saliva      of 33%-50%. Furthermore, the research group has shown that the stem cell group gained vital      quality of life measures compared with the placebo group in the form of diminished trouble in      eating.      The research group has furthermore recently investigated the safety of allogenic ASCs for the      treatment of xerostomia (MESRIX-II) with a clinical safety and feasible trial (EudraCT nb:      2018-003856-19). The study included ten patients who received intraglandular injections of      allogeneic ASCs. No serious treatment-related adverse reaction occurred, and the efficacy      data was similar to the results from our first trial with autologous ASCs.      Research hypothesis Treatment with ASCs will result in an improvement of the participant's      unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rate and ameliorate the xerostomia and increase      quality of life.      Study aim The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of      allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and      xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to      develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering      from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful      since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom      of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.      Study design The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center,      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the safety, tolerability and      efficacy of ASCs as a treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia for      previous head and neck cancer patients.      Method Patients between the age of 18-70 years previously treated with radiation for a head      and neck cancer and a clinically evaluated reduced salivation and hyposalivation, evaluated      by a screening, can be included. Each participant will be double-blindly randomized to      receive either allogeneic ASCs or placebo consisting of CryoStor10 (BiolifeSolutions), the      freeze media for ASCs containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Allogeneic ASCs are provided      from the Cardiology Stem Cell Centre (CSCC) at Rigshospitalet.      Patients will be evaluated on salivary gland function and saliva flow rate by sialometry.      Both unstimulated whole saliva and stimulated whole saliva will be collected. Furthermore,      the investigators will analyze the following on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by      ionic balance estimation, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride, total      protein and selected proteins, and amylase. For evaluation of the participants´ perception of      xerostomia, the participants will answer validated questionnaires in Danish (EORTC QLQ Module      for H&N-35 and XQ) at baseline and after four months. These patient-reported outcomes (PRO)      questionnaires are essential, validated tools for estimating the degree of quality of life      (QoL) and xerostomia.      Recruitment of MESRIX-III participants and obtaining informed consent MESRIX-III participants      (recipients/placebo) will be recruited through the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and      Neck Surgery at Rigshospitalet and Oncology Departments at Rigshospitalet and Herlev      Hospital, and through our databases on head and neck cancer patients. The investigator will      send a letter to eligible patients who have been treated and followed for their previous      cancer disease. Eligible patients can also contact the investigators or a trained member of      the MESRIX-III study by phone or by a specific study e-mail      (regionh-stamcelle.rigshospitalet@regionh.dk) if the eligible patients wish to receive a      letter with further information. Subsequently, the principal investigator or a trained member      of the MESRIX-III study group will contact patients by phone and inquire about their interest      in participating in the research project.      If the eligible patients have an interest in participating in the project, the eligible      patients will be invited to an interview at the outpatient clinic of the Department of      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Rigshospitalet for further information concerning the      trial. In the written information material, besides material about the trial, the pamphlets      ""Rights of test subjects in a health scientific research project"" and ""before decision"" will      be included. The right to bring counsel to the information interview will likewise be      explained. Motivated patients referred from doctors in other parts of Denmark and patients      who approach our department with an interest in participation in the stem cell research will      also be offered information about the trial. Patients from all parts of Denmark can be      included if the participants pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria described below.      However, transportation and accommodation cannot be provided.      The information interview will take place in an undisturbed environment with the principal      investigator or trained member of the MESRIX-III study group, who has the professional      qualifications to communicate the content of the research project, and who will clearly      explain that it is a request to participate in a health science research project. The      participant will be given oral information about the project in layman's terms on the basis      of the written information, and any questions will be answered. The oral information will be      adapted to the participant's requirements, and it will be explained without the use of      technical terms. Participants will be informed of the right to reflection following the      information interview. Participants will likewise be informed of the opportunity to get      feedback on the scientific results but will also be informed that no new information on the      individual participant's disease or prognosis will be obtained. The potential participants      for MESRIX-III will be contacted by telephone by the responsible physician for final      commitment to participate. If participants are still interested in participating in the      project, an appointment is made where a medical history is taken, and where the remaining      trial appointments will be planned in agreement with the participant, and here the      participants and the responsible physician will sign the medical consent form.      Evaluation, reporting, and recording of adverse events All adverse events (AEs) are monitored      and recorded along with concomitant medicine at the scheduled follow-up (day one, and 4      months after the intervention). AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the      clinical trial participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily      have a causal relationship with the treatment (ASC/placebo). AEs will be assessed and graded      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 guidelines (CTCAEv5.0).      Thus, all adverse events are recorded with CTCAE grade. All grade 3 and grade 4 events and      incidents considered related to this trial will be reported to the sponsor by the      investigator immediately after the events are discovered.      An adverse reaction (AR) is defined as any untoward or unintended response in a participant      to an investigational medical product (IMP) which is related to any dose administered to that      subject.      An adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is stated as all noxious and unintended responses to a      medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADR.      Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR), or Suspected Unexpected Serious      Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), means any AE, AE, SUSAR, respectively, that:        1. Results in death or        2. A serious deterioration in health that             1. Resulted in life-threatening illness or injury             2. Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization             3. Resulted in permanent impairment of body structure or body function             4. Resulted in medical or surgical treatment to prevent the above        3. Lead to foetal death, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other negative effect on           the foetus        4. Anything the Principal Investigator deems to be of Clinical serious significance      Medical judgment will be exercised by the primary investigator together with the sponsor      whether an AE or AR should be classified as serious in other situations.      The included participants will be instructed to contact the principal investigator or a      special trained person from the research group in case of events with possible relation to      the trial treatment within the main study period.      The principal investigator will immediately (within maximum 24 hours after receiving the      information) inform the sponsor if SAR, SAE or serious suspected adverse reactions occurs.      The sponsor will report SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) to the Danish      Medicines Agency and the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics within 15 days      of occurrence and 7 days in case of death or life-threatening issue. Unexpected reactions are      defined as reactions that are not described in the section ""Reference Safety information"" of      this protocol. All other unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported within 15 days      after the sponsor becomes aware of these.      All SARs that have occurred during the trial will be reported to The Danish Medicines Agency,      The Danish Patient Safety Authority, and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (if      appropriate) once a year by the sponsor.      The sponsor will annually send a concise review and evaluation of pertinent safety      information, a Development Safety update report (DSUR) collected during the reporting period      related to the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA).      After completion of the trial, the sponsor will after 90 days inform the Danish Medicines      Agency that the study is completed. Within a year, the sponsor will submit trial results to      the board, according to the law on drugs (Lov om lægemidler) § 89. 2, No. 4      Reference safety information (RSI) Adverse events with possible relation to injection of      ASCs: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not      serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary swelling of      the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious      Adverse events with relation to similar procedures and in MESRIX-I: Type; Frequency;      Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;      Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;      Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;      Not serious Infection of the salivary gland; 0.5-5%; Not serious Bleeding/hematoma in the      salivary gland; 1-5%; Not serious      The above numbers and AEs are based on the previous phase I-II trial (EudraCT:      2014-004349-29) and on the literature cited and described in the section ""Risk Assessment"".      In the previous study by the research group, MESRIX-I, with autologous ASCs no SAR or SUSARs      were detected, so any SAR in this study will be reported as a SUSAR.      Long-term safety and efficacy follow-up Following Committee for Medicinal Products for Human      Use (CHMP) under EMEA draft from January 2018 on safety and efficacy (S&E) follow-up and risk      management of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), the MESRIX-III participants will be      invited to a follow-up of efficacy and ARs one year after the intervention (ASCs/placebo).      Longer follow-up is not needed based on the reported long-term safety described in the      section.      ""Risk Assessment"". Follow-up will include basic ear, nose, and throat examination,      fiberscope, ultrasound of submandibular glands, sialometry, and blood samples. Data from the      electronic medical journals and national pathology database will be gathered. It is expected      that a number of the participants will have a recurrence of their primary cancer during the      study or follow-up period due to the nature of the head and neck cancer. The allogeneic MSCs      are believed to be rejected in the recipients, and the stem cells are adult non-pluripotent.      However, in case of recurrence of cancer or new primary cancer developments each case will be      carefully evaluated and potentially investigated with genetic analysis in an attempt to      distinguish whether a tumor is due to recurrence, the administered product, or endogenous      tumor formation.      Sample size and power considerations From MESRIX-I it appeared to be realistic to increase      saliva production for whole unstimulated salivary flow (in milliliter(ml)/minut) rate by      about 33% or in absolute numbers from 0.125 to 0.151 after 1 month and 0.155 after 4 months.      The power calculation is based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. This means that the      total number of patients included would have to be 100 (50 in each group) for a paired      t-test. 10-20 additional participants may be included to compensate for dropout during the      study period. The investigators believe that a 33% increase in whole, unstimulated salivary      flow rate is clinically important and also realistic to detect.      Ethical considerations The trial is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration.      The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency (DPA)      will be requested permission to conduct the study. Moreover, the Danish Medicines Agency will      be requested approval, and the trial will be monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP)      unit (Birgitte Grøn). Each volunteer (MESRIX-III participants) is required to give written      informed consent before he/she can be included in the study. Information obtained about      participants' health, other purely private matters, and other confidential information is      covered by professional secrecy. No project participant has a personal financial incentive to      implement the described project. The samples will be analyzed and stored in Denmark.      Risk assessment When the study participants in MESRIX-III will receive either ASCs or placebo      into the large salivary glands the risk of adverse events such as infection and bleeding is      estimated to be below 0.5% when using similar procedures. In our previous studies, none of      the 40 participants developed adverse reactions.      The MESRIX-III participants may also experience some pain briefly during injection of the      transplant product (ASCs or placebo).      A theoretical risk of a possible carcinogenic effect in the treatment of MSC/ASCs has been      discussed. This is due to their production of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor      (EGF), a factor produced by the MSC/ASCs. These considerations are particularly relevant      since ASCs are used in participants previously diagnosed with cancer. However, in model      systems of cancer, the effect of MSCs on cancer growth is controversial as MSCs have both      been shown to be inhibitory and stimulatory. Further, numerous clinical trials with more than      1000 participants have been conducted with MSCs in different participant populations, and no      increase in the incidence of cancer has been detected. These studies include local injection      of MSCs. With respect to the use of ex vivo expanded MSCs, despite extensive research, there      is no data indicating malignant transformation of expanded human MSCs/ASCs.      Data collection Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report      Form (CRF).      The study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring,      audit, and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines      Authority, or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA      for the processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.      Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet.      Data will be analyzed with R. Our data will be kept securely in the electronic data capture      system (EDC) Redcap. All data will be directly entered. The trial will be completed when all      data is collected.      All results will be stored and analyzed electronically; participants' anonymity is ensured in      accordance with the national data legislation. After completion of the study, data will be      stored in an anonymous form. Data containing social security numbers will be kept locked and      inaccessible to unauthorized persons.      Subject confidentially The investigator is obliged to ensure that participant anonymity is      protected and maintained. On the CRF´s subjects should be identified by their initials and a      subject study number only, Documents that are not for submission (e.g., signed informed      consent forms) will be kept in strict confidence by the principal investigator. In compliance      with the GCP Guidelines, it is required that the investigator and the institution permit      authorized representatives of a monitoring company direct access to reviewing subjects'      original medical records for verification of study-related procedures and data. All      information obtained concerning this protocol regarding participants is protected according      to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).    ",,"

",      Mesenchymal stem cells have been tested in many autoimmune disorders with encouraging results      and may be an alternative to the treatment of immune-mediated severe acquired aplastic      anemia.    ,"      Acquired aplastic anemia is a bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by and empty bone      marrow and low blood counts. Most of the cases are immune-mediated. Allogeneic bone marrow      transplant is the preferable treatment modality for patients younger than 40 years with a      matched sibling donor. Patients not eligible for transplant are treated with intensive      immunosuppressive therapy often based on anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine.      However, up to one third of patients treated with immunosuppression are refractory and one      third of those who response eventually relapse. Refractory and relapsed cases may be the      result of insufficient immunosuppression and these cases may benefit from additional      immunosuppression. Mesenchymal stem cells infusion may be a potential treatment option,      considering its properties to modulate the immune system.      Refractory or relapsed patients with aplastic anemia will be treated with conventional      immunosuppressive regimen (anti-thymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine) combined with      intravenous infusion of allogeneic unrelated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

","      HBV-related liver failure (HBV-LF), a dramatic clinical syndrome, is characterized with      massive necrosis of liver cells. Liver transplantation might be the most effective therapy      for HBV-LF. However, there are a lot of problems such as lack of donors, surgical      complications, transplant rejection, and high cost, which could limit the application of      liver transplantation. It is demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells could directionally      differentiate into hepatocytes and cholangiocytes in injured liver, as well as reduce      inflammation of the liver by immune regulation. In this study, we assess the safety and      efficacy of human bone marrow and umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells transplantation for      patients with HBV-LF.    ",,,"

","      ABO incompatible liver transplantations is considered to be a rescue option in emergency      transplantation.The A、B antibodies to grafts bind to the graft endothelium and activate      complement, which attracts and activates neutrophils and platelets and increases the      permeability of the endothelium. The neutrophils exude, the platelets aggregate, and the      small vessels of the graft get thrombosed, resulting in ischemic damage,leading nonfunction      grafts.In addition, if the A、 B antibodies remain high level, it can lead to acute humoral      immune rejection. A lot of research confirmed that the ABO incompatible is a risk factor of      postoperative short- and long-term survival. And mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are      characterized by the properties of immunosuppressive and regenerative properties, which make      MSCs great attractive in treating immunological diseases (including transplant rejection) and      organ/tissue ischemic injury.

","      The purpose of this study is to utilize Trinity Evolution as a graft source in foot/ankle      fusions and to follow the subjects to measure the clinical outcomes and fusion rate. The      hypothesis of the study is that Trinity Evolution will result in fusion rates and clinical      outcomes similar to those obtained from autograft and other routinely used allograft      materials; these include: fusion, improvement in pain, improvement in function, and absence      of adverse events related to the use of the graft source.    ","      Symptomatic arthritic conditions of the foot and ankle including osteoarthritis,      post-traumatic arthritis, inflammatory arthropathies and others can be painful and disabling      conditions that lead to a reduced quality of life. Major symptoms include pain, stiffness,      swelling, and difficulty walking. Many patients may be initially treatable with non-invasive      measures such as analgesics, ankle-foot orthosis, physical therapy and medications such as      steroids; however, over time, surgery becomes necessary to improve quality of life and      maintain function. Arthrodesis is a well-known procedure that can reduce pain and result in a      foot/ankle that can withstand an active lifestyle.      Bone graft is used to stimulate new bone formation at the operative site by providing      osteogenic cells with osteoinductive factors with an osteoconductive matrix. Although      autologous bone is often used as the structural graft material for fusion procedures, donor      site morbidity (e.g., pain, infection, and fracture), limited supply, and inconsistent      osteogenic activity continue to be associated problems. The quality of an autograft is      dependent upon the age and medical condition of the patient, as well as the number of viable      mesenchymal and osteoprogenitor stem cells that are present in the specimen. This tissue is      harvested during the surgical procedure; the process can prolong morbidity at the harvest      site. The ideal bone graft would offer osteogenic cells, osteoinductive factors, and an      osteoconductive matrix with a consistent supply of viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and      osteoprogenitor cells (OPCs)-but without the morbidity of autograft.      Due to the limitations associated with autograft, researchers are pursuing the use of      bone-graft substitutes to promote arthrodesis. Bone-graft substitutes now being used by      surgeons include ceramic synthetics, bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), demineralized bone      matrices (DBMs) and other allografts; these may be used alone or in combination. Allografts      available as substitutes for autograft offer some of the benefits of autograft without its      limitations-but do not contain viable MSCs and OPCs.      Trinity Evolution is an allogeneic cancellous bone matrix containing demineralized cortical      bone (DCB) as well as viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem cells. Adult mesenchymal      stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells, such as those in Trinity Evolution, are the precursor      cells that differentiate into osteoblasts-the cells responsible for bone growth and repair.      Trinity Evolution provides the required osteoconduction, osteogenesis, and osteoinductivity      necessary for successful bone grafting. It offers viable osteoprogenitor and mesenchymal stem      cells and demineralized cortical bone-all in a single product. Data from preclinical studies      with Trinity Evolution have demonstrated in-vitro and in-vivo safety and effectiveness.      Trinity Evolution is a ""minimally manipulated"" tissue that is considered an allograft, and as      such, is labeled for bone repair for all orthopedic and podiatric indications where autograft      is used. In this study, Trinity Evolution will be used as a substitute for autograft and/or      standard allograft in the following arthrodesis procedures: tibiotalar, subtalar,      calcaneocuboid, talonavicular, double fusions (i.e. calcaneocuboid and talonavicular), and      triple fusions (i.e. subtalar, calcaneocuboid, and talonavicular).

",      This is a non-randomized clinical trial conducted in a single tertiary hospital which      investigates the efficacy of allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells and human      amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM) composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation    ,"      Supraspinatus tendon tear is the most common factor causing shoulder pain, mainly resulting      in discomfort and functional deficit in individuals over the age of 35. Supraspinatus tendon      repair surgery represents one of the most widely performed types of orthopedic operation.      Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding tendon-to-bone healing during the postoperative      period. Despite advancements in surgical technique, re-tear of a previously repaired      supraspinatus tendon is a fairly common complication, especially in a larger size tear. Such      repair technique employing suture anchor devices alone has not yet produced functional      results demonstrating both anatomical and biomechanical properties. Therefore, tendon tissue      engineering using a combination of scaffolds, cells, and growth factors stimulation offers a      potential solution as a biological augmentation in tendon repair.      Human amniotic membrane (HAM) has been widely used as a natural scaffold in tissue      engineering due to many of its unique properties such as providing growth factors, cytokines      and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, adequate mechanical strength, and      biocompatibility. Whereas, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) constitute one of the adult stem      cells that promote replacement and repair of damaged tissue along with normal tissue      turnover. These MSCs are seeded to the HAM scaffolds to biologically augment tendon repair,      with MSCs acting as cytokines/growth factors to stimulate tissue repair. This approach serves      as the foundation to conduct the present study. The investigators aim to investigate the      efficacy of using allogeneic adipose-derived MSCs and human amniotic membrane (AAdMSC-HAM)      composite for supraspinatus tendon repair augmentation.

Tear recurrence (re-tear)
Throughout the study duration (12 months), recorded as the first time complained by the patients (i.e. after ""n"" months).
A systematic review (D'Ambrosi et al., 2019) showed that re-tear rates after rotator cuff repair with scaffolds were 17.97%. We hypothesize that the augmentation using HAM (as scaffold) seeded with AAdMSC would further lower the re-tear rates. We plan to record the recurrence of supraspinatus tendon tear (if any) based on radiographic evaluation with ultrasonography, which will then be confirmed with MRI. Ultrasonography provides an excellent anatomical evaluation of soft tissue which is able to assess any alterations during active locomotion. However, due to its user-dependent nature, we will also confirm the findings with MRI examination. Any grade of re-tear (grade I-III as evaluated by ultrasonography and confirmed with MRI) will be counted in and classified as ""re-tear"". When the patients do not complain about any symptoms of re-tear, we will record them as ""no re-tear"".

Procedure
Tendon repair procedure
Tendon repair procedure:
Single senior surgeon (HS) will perform mini-open surgery to decompress the acromioplasty and repair the supraspinatus tendon.
Splicing is achieved by installing screw-type anchors on the insertional footprint of the humeral head greater tuberosity.
Then, double suturing of the supraspinatus tendon is performed.

",      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of CD25 monoclonal antibody and      calcineurin inhibitors with or without mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating patients      with steroid-resistant acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic      stem cell transplantation.    ,"      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective therapy for      several hematological disorders. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and      treatment of side effects associated with transplantation, aGVHDremains a common and      life-threatening complication with poor prognosis. Corticosteroids are still acted as the      first-line treatments of aGVHD, with a response rate of 50-80. However, those who failed to      initial therapy only have 10-30% long-term survival.      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be      isolated from many tissues, such as bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue and umbilical cord. Such      cells possess the capacity to suppress immunological responses, support hematopoiesis and      repair tissues. Clinical applications of human MSCs are evolving rapidly for preventing and      treating GVHD. Although the results are still controversy, most prospective and retrospective      data suggest that MSCs are effective to aGVHD.      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors combined with CD25 monoclonal      antibody and calcineurin inhibitors in treating patients with aGVHD.

The novelty of the current UMSC01      treatment study is the dual route of administration. Since dual administration of UCMSC via      IA and IV had never been conducted in humans, there may be unknown risks to humans not      predicted from the preclinical studies. However, the risk to patients in this trial will be      minimized by rigorous adherence to the eligibility criteria, use of appropriate dose and      concentration of stem cells, standardized techniques of stem cell infusion, and intensive      patient monitoring during and after stem cell infusion.    ","      Each year about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke in the United      States.Stroke is a leading cause of death, along with cancer and coronary heart disease, and      the most common cause of physical disability in adults. Moreover, stroke causes a greater      loss of healthy life years, as measured in disability adjusted life years, than other      diseases.

","      This protocol was a prospective, Phase I study of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation      (BMT) as the primary therapy for Osteogenesis Imperfecta Types II and III. Compatible sibling      donors and unrelated donors were stratified and analyzed according to the type of donor. All      patients with a sibling donor will received a chemotherapy conditioning regimen; a non-T cell      depleted allogeneic marrow, and GVHD prophylaxis. All patients with an unrelated donor will      receive a chemoradiotherapy conditioning regimen, a T-cell depleted allogeneic marrow, and      GVHD prophylaxis. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the safety and      toxicity of these BMT procedures in this particular population.    ",      The secondary objective of the protocol assessed the engraftment of donor mesenchymal cells      and their ability to increase the synthesis of normal type I procollagen relative to the      synthesis of mutated type I procollagen and to assess whether BMT improves the bone structure      and the clinical condition of these patients with OI.    ,,"

","        Inclusion Criteria:          -  Patient has diagnosis of OI Type II or III. Because there are no specific, defined             clinical criteria consistently used to make this diagnosis, we provide the following             clinical guidelines to assist in diagnosis. Any appropriate combinations of the             following clinical findings will be acceptable.        Diagnosis of OI Type II          -  Antenatal ultrasonography (if performed for other indications) by established             obstetric impressions including short femurs, a small thoracic cage and poorly             mineralized bones. Analysis of collagen synthesized from cultured cells obtained from             chorionic villus sampling (CVS) may establish the diagnosis; however, no CVS will be             performed specifically for enrollment into this study.          -  Clinical examination including prematurity, low birth weight, characteristic facies             (blue sclera, beaked nose, extremely soft calvarium), ""frog-leg"" hips, small thoracic             cavity, fractures at birth or shortly thereafter, loose skin or lax joints that cannot             be readily explained by other factors.          -  Radiographic evaluation demonstrating various aspects of the characteristic picture of             telescoped femur, bowed tibias, beaded ribs, flattened vertebral bodies and virtual             absence of calvarial mineralization.        Diagnosis of OI Type III          -  Antenatal ultrasonography (performed for other indications) by established obstetric             impressions for this more moderate form of OI. Chorionic villus sampling will be             accepted as above.          -  Clinical examination including short stature, bony deformities, many fractures at             birth or shortly thereafter. Blue scleras and dental abnormalities are also common.          -  Radiographic abnormalities including thin, osteopenic bones of the limbs with evidence             of fractures, growth plate abnormalities, and an undermineralized calvarium.          -  Diagnosis of other diseases with possibly similar presentation to OI (e.g.             hypophosphatasia and rickets) should be excluded by obtaining a serum calcium,             phosphate and alkaline phosphatase. These parameters can be expected to be within             normal limits (alkaline phosphatase may be somewhat elevated) in patients with OI.          -  Age less than 3 years at time of transplant.          -  Parents or legal guardians must sign an informed consent indicating that they are             aware this is a research study and have been told of its possible benefits and toxic             side effects, including treatment related mortality. Patients or their guardians will             be given a copy of the consent form.          -  Identification of a suitable bone marrow donor.          -  Any donor must be of sufficient size so that adequate bone marrow may be harvested.          -  HLA mismatched sibling or unrelated donor. DNA typing will be per- formed on unrelated             donors. Donors must be a 6/6 match or a 5/6 match (with serologic mismatch at a single             Class I allele or mismatch at a single DR1 allele).        Exclusion Criteria:          -  Patients who are ventilatory dependent due to primary lung parenchymal disease prior             to BMT.          -  Patients with evidence of basilar invagination/compression.

",      Very preterm infants are at high risk to develop to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) for the      lack of effective measures to prevent or ameliorate this common and serious disorder. BPD      remains a major cause of mortality and lifelong morbidity in preterm infants    ,"      Several studies have shown that transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in      immunocompetent animals attenuates lung injury, such as impaired alveolarization,      inflammatory response, increased apoptosis, and fibrosis. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB)      is considered a better source of MSCs because of their ready availability and greater      proliferative capacity and less antigenicity than other cell types.      transplantation of hUCB-derived MSCs should be effective in treating BPD. The safety and      efficacy of MSC transplantation for prevention of BPD has not been tested previously,      however.    ",,"

",      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of using Ossium      vertebral Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (vBM-MSC) to treat people with an ileal      pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) who develop a fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease of the      pouch.    ,"      Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with      restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional      outcomes and quality of life.1 2 While less than 30% of patients experience short-term      postoperative morbidity following IPAA,3-5 up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to      technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the      pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations.1,2,6-8 Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is      notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local      repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a      devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.1      Given the high safety profile, and relative success in treating perianal disease, we sought      to use a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs to establish safety and secondarily      monitor for healing in patients with ileal anal anastomosis and ileal pouch fistulas. This      trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce      regenerative signals.      This study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior      and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Subjects who are      refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Subjects enrolled will be      those that meet current indications.    ",,"

Jointstem
JOINTSTEM is an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As it does not use allogenic tissues and is incubated without additional genetic modification or mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.

Subject with perianal      fistulising Crohn's disease will be treated with Cx601, suspension of eASCs, at a dose of 120      million cells administered by intralesional injection. The treatment of complex perianal      fistulas by local application of eASCs intends to improve significantly the local conditions      with very few inconveniences (ambulatory procedure) and minimal risk of possible      complications (anal incontinence). Therefore, this is a new therapeutic resource that is      expected to be safe and efficacious as well as is expected to improve the quality of life of      the patients in this highly debilitating and chronic condition. This treatment would prevent      one of the main causes of anal incontinence, would diminish recurrence of the fistula disease      and would reduce drastically the significant disorders provoked by the standard fistula      surgery in the patients. Indeed, patients can be discharged according to the ""One Day      Surgical"" procedures (major ambulatory surgery).    ",,"

Biological
Mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells
The active agent in CYP-001 is allogeneic mesenchymoangioblast-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MCA-derived MSCs), which are produced using the proprietary Cymerus™ platform technology. Cymerus™ refers to the process of generating cell-based products from intermediate cells, MCAs, which in turn are derived from induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs. The iPSCs used in the Cymerus™ process were derived from blood donated by a fully-consented healthy adult donor, and were reprogrammed using a transgene-free, viral-free and feeder-free technique.

","      Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of a new medicinal product of the somatic cell therapy class      (eASCs). This study is designed as a multicenter, single blind, fixed dose escalation, with      three treatment groups, controlled with placebo (randomization 3:1) whose target population      are patients with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to at least two biologic.    ","      Traditionally, RA has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,      glucocorticoids and non-biologics-DMARDs. Only non-biologics-DMARDs and, at a lesser extent,      glucocorticoids have shown to be able to prevent or interrupt the inflammatory and      destructive disease processes.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic stromal cells that are able to      differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, and      adipose. MSCs can be easily isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue and rapidly expanded      in culture. MSCs have also been shown to have immuno-suppressive and healing capacities,      improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties could be used for novel      therapeutic applications in various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis      (OA), genetic bone and cartilage disorders and bone metastasis. MSCs can potently modulate      immune responses, showing antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory capacities.      This study is a multicenter phase Ib/IIa, escalating dose, single blind clinical trial to      assess the safety of the intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived      mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) to refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerance, and      to identify, if possible, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose for future clinical      trials on efficacy of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs for patients suffering      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under treatment with at least one non-biologic-Disease modifying      antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) who have previously failed to treatment with at least two      biologics. The secondary objective is to obtain information on the clinical and functional      effects of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs in patients with RA and to explore      pharmacodynamics parameters.      53 patients (i.e. patients having received at least one dose of study treatment) in three      different cohorts are planned to be included in this clinical trial. Expansion will start      after acute toxicity assessment of the first three patients of each cohort.      Dose and intervals for the trial consist of the following active groups: a) first cohort: 1      million cells/kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; b) second cohort: 2 million cells / kg      administered at days 1, 8 and 15; c) third cohort: 4 million cells / kg administered at days      1, 8 and 15.

",      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with or      without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral stem cells (PBSC)      in treating patients experiencing poor graft function or delayed platelet engraftment after      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.    ,"      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) is the only cure for many      hematologic diseases. However, about 5-27% of patients would suffer from poor graft function      (PGF) and more recipients might develop delayed platelet engraftment (DPE) after allo-HSCT.      These complications are associated with considerable mortality related to infections or      hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF and DPE usually involves hematopoietic growth      factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin (TPO), or      second transplantation, but these methods have dismal effect or even a significant risk of      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs      include improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and treating graft-versus-host      disease after allo-HSCT and so on. Some studies have shown that MSCs combined with PBSC or      cord blood could be useful to improve engraftment after HSCT. Several reports suggested MSCs      might be effective in the treatment of PGF.      However, the efficacy of MSCs as single-drug treatment for PGF or DPE is unsatisfactory in      our previous study. Therefore, in the present study, G-CSF mobilized PBSC will be used      combined with MSCs in the patients with PGF or DPE after allo-HSCT.    ",,"

","      Knee-osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and disabling problem, that represents a global health      issue since none of the current therapies are truly disease modifying. The use of mesenchymal      stem cells (MSCs) in OA-preclinical models has been associated with a reduction in cartilage      degradation, the attenuation of bone sclerosis and an effective anti-inflammatory response.      Investigators have designed a randomized phase I/II placebo controlled trial of UC-MSCs in      knee OA. Outcomes will be evaluated at 12 months, comparing monodosis versus double      intra-articular injection, re-randomized at 6 months.    ",,,"
