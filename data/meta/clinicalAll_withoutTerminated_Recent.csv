",      This phase I trial studies the best dose and side effects of mesenchymal stromal      cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA (iExosomes) in treating participants with      pancreatic cancer with KrasG12D mutation that has spread to other places in the body.      iExosomes may work better at treating pancreatic cancer.    ,"      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived      exosomes loaded with small interference RNA (siRNA) against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in      metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients with KrasG12D mutation.      II. To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived      exosomes loaded with siRNA against KrasG12D (iExosomes) in metastatic PDAC patients with      KrasG12D mutation.      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of iExosomes. II. Assess the overall response rate of      iExosomes in the chosen patient population.      III. Assess the disease control rate (partial response + stable disease) with therapy.      IV. Determine median progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment. V. Determine the      median overall survival (OS) with this treatment.      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:      I. Evaluate optional tissue collection and serum-derived exosomes and circulating-free      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) for detection of DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA) showing      KrasG12D sequence; evaluate DNA and RNA showing KrasG12D sequence in optional tissue      collection.      II. Evaluate the siRNA content in blood and optional tissue collection.      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.      Participants receive mesenchymal stromal cells-derived exosomes with KrasG12D siRNA      intravenously (IV) over 15-20 minutes on days 1, 4, and 10. Treatment repeats every 14 days      for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.      Participants who respond may continue 3 additional courses.      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, then every 3      months for up to 1 year.    ",,"

","      Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are both      associated with the prevailing upper respiratory tract infections caused by the      RNA-containing SARS-CoV2 virus of the genius Betacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae family. As      both the viral infiltration and infection progress, the host immune system response can be      one of a rapidly developing fatal cytokine storm. In the ARDS or NCP ensuing progression, the      patient often succumbs to the effects of the hyper pro-inflammatory response, hence      contributing to the associated increased mortality as a result of the cytokine storm and      associated pathogenesis.    ","      In December of 2019, in Wuhan, China, a novel coronavirus outbreak began. Globally this      disease referred to as COVID-19, is the result of a novel SARS-CoV2 virus which predominantly      targets Type II lung alveolar cells (AT2). The hyper response of the host immune system can      rapidly evolve into a life-threatening cytokine-release syndrome or cytokine storm. The      cytokine storm can predispose the patient to ARDS and/or NCP., or both. Left unchecked, the      ARDS pathogenesis rapidly culminates in disruption of cell cytotoxicity mechanisms, excessive      activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, and a predominance of type I (M1) macrophage; resulting      in the massive release of a host of proinflammatory cytokines (FNO-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8,      IL-10), granulocytic colony-stimulating factor, monocytic chemoattractive protein 1. The      result systemically is a rise in surrogate inflammatory markers (C Reactive Protein, serum      ferritin), with a corresponding infiltration of internal organs and tissues by activated      macrophage, T-lymphocytes and a predominance of cellular apoptosis. The resulting      hyperinflammatory pathogenic reaction may result in severe aveolar lesions leading to death,      scarring, or severe lung damage, persisting well after discharge.      Experimental studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-culutre      media (MSC-CM) may significantly reduce the pro-inflammatory bias and associated pathologic      impairment resulting. The MSC-CM, known to contain exosomes, has been shown to have an      anti-inflammatory effect. Further exosomes associated with the amniotic membrane, long used      in the treatment of burn and wounds, have been show to have a regenerative effect.      The purpose of this protocol is to explore the safety and efficacy of an intravenous      injection of MSC derived exosomes in the treatment of severe patients (moderate to severe      Berlin score) with ARDS or NCP.

","      This study aims to evaluate bone formation in grafts in terms of its quality (density),      quantity (volume) and maturation obtained with the application of a tissue-engineered bone      grafting compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-culture medium (CM) and a synthetic      bone substitute. The present study was designed as an experimental prospective split-mouth      randomized controlled clinical trial. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics      Committee, a total of 20 consecutive participants in need of maxillary reconstruction aiming      implant-supported oral rehabilitation will be invited to join the study. To collect      autogenous adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs), an outpatient lipoplasty      procedure at the abdominal area of each patient will be performed. To isolate and expand      hASCs from the lipoaspirate, specific cell culture protocols will be followed, resulting in      cultured viable cells and their conditioned medium (CM). Cells and CM will be then separated      by a sequence of filters and centrifugation, and isolated CM will be frozen. ELISA will      analyze the presence of chemokines and their concentration in CM before grafting. Following      pre-op surgical planning, both maxillary sinuses of each patient will be grafted internally      applying a lateral window to each sinus. The bony floor of the test maxillary sinus will be      augmented with synthetic bone substitute (BoneCeramic™ 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM      (test). The control site will receive bone substitute with saline. Lateral windows in both      sinuses will be then closed with a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide™). After 6 months, first-stage      implant surgery will be performed placing 6 implants in each patient. Registration of implant      stability by manual torque wrench will be performed. Also, bone biopsies from each drilled      implant site will be collected for histology, histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry      (RT-PCR). Tomographic evaluation of the bone formation will include cone beam computed      tomographies (CBCTs) at pre-operative [Baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2 = implant placement]      days for bone 3D image analysis.    ","      1. Aims and Hypothesis           Based in previously reported studies and following a translational approach, a           hypothesis that the paracrine effect linked to cultured autogenous growth factors and           cytokines at physiologic concentrations acting locally in grafted sites might promote a           faster and/or more efficient cell response and consequently induce a more           significant/faster bone formation was considered. The presence of these molecules added           to synthetic bone substitutes might act positively in terms of local cell recruitment           (chemotaxis), proliferation, differentiation and bone protein synthesis. Also, recurrent           biological hazards involved in conventional tissue-engineered cellular graft compounds,           usually linked to the ex vivo manipulation of cells in terms of tumorigenicity,           immunogenicity and the previously reported cell dedifferentiation phenomenon would be           mitigated by the exclusion of the cell element of this process, as they are considered           by some reports to present unpredictable mitotic behavior once artificially cultured.           The present study aims to further extend this translational investigation following           preclinical studies by the principal investigator, proposing a prospective randomized           controlled clinical trial on the possible benefits associated with the application of a           tissue-engineered bone graft compound containing concentrated autogenous cell-cultured           medium (CM) and an hydroxylapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate-based synthetic bone           substitute (HP/β-TCP ceramic). Specific aims include analyses on the density of the           newly formed calcified tissue by computed tomography (CBCTs), expression of specific           immunohistochemical bone formation markers (RT-PCR) and histomorphometric bone quantity           evaluation. In a split-mouth study model, the resultant bone formation after HP/β-TCP           grafting with and without CM will be analyzed, compared and quantified at different time           points.        2. Materials and Methods      2.1- Study design      A prospective split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial was chosen as study design for      the present investigation. After protocol approval by the Research Ethics Committee and      registration at the clinical trials.gov platform, following CONSORT guidelines, 20      consecutive patients who seek maxillary oral rehabilitation at the Department of Prosthetic      Dentistry of the School of Health and Life Sciences - PUCRS, Brazil, will be invited to      participate in the present investigation.      2.2 - Lipoplasty and human adipose stem cells (hASCs) harvesting/culture.      For hASCs harvesting, an abdominal lipoplasty procedure will be proposed and performed      following a signed informed consent. Under intravenous sedation and supplementary oxygen      release with an oral catheter, along with local anesthesia, a standard surgical lipoplasty      technique will be performed. As previously described, from this liposuction material, 25 to      30 ml of fat will be transferred into a 50 ml Falcon tube. The fat will be then washed by      centrifugation (430Å~g 10 min), being the upper fat layer transferred into a new Falcon tube,      where an equal volume of collagenase solution will be added to the mixture and incubated at      37°C in a water bath. After centrifugation, the upper fat layer will be discarded and the      supernatant removed. The remaining cell pellet containing the hASCs will be resuspended with      15 ml of culture medium. After adding 15 ml of warm culture medium, the cell suspension will      be transferred into a T175 culture flask. The hASCs will be incubated in a humidified      environment at 37°C and 5% CO2. Then, the cell pellet will be resuspended in warm culture      medium and seeded into new cell culture flasks.      2.3 - Concentrated culture medium (CM) preparation and analysis      Stem cell culture and CM preparation will be performed at a GMP certified facility for      regenerative medicine products. At first, the surface antigen profiles of isolated hASCs at      third passage will be characterized by flow cytometry. The presence of CD73, CD90, CD105 and      CD44 markers and the absence of CD34, CD45, CD11b, CD19 and HLA-DR will be assessed to      confirm the desired cell phenotype as recommended by protocols of the International Society      of Cellular Therapy.[ Then, a sample of these cells will be also characterized by staining      (Alizarin Red S) in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell expansion and CM will      be generated following standard stem cell culture protocols. Before clinical use, CM will be      examined not only for contamination with bacteria, fungi, or mycoplasmas but also for      infection with viruses including hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency and human T-cell      leukemia viruses. Then, CM will be properly cool-stored and sent to clinical application (up      to 6 hours), to avoid long-term denaturation/inactivation of present signalling molecules, as      previously suggested.      2.4 - Maxillary sinus floor elevation procedure      Under IV sedation and supplementary oxygen release with an oral catheter, along with local      anesthesia, the maxillary bone will be grafted internally by drilling an access in the      lateral maxillary sinus wall. Sinus membrane dissection with careful release and elevation      will be also performed. Preoperative randomizing by computer-generated random numbers will be      used to determine test and control sinuses for each patient. The bony floor of the maxillary      sinus on the test site will be augmented with 4 to 5g of a synthetic bone substitute      (BoneCeramic™ 1-2 mm) mixed with 10 to 15 ml of CM. The control site will receive similar      amount of bone substitute embedded in 10 to 15 ml of saline solution. Patients will be      released from hospital facility 2h after surgery. They will be instructed in postoperative      hygiene and eating behavior. All patients will receive postoperative antibiotic and      anti-inflammatory therapies.      2.5 - Implant placement and bone biopsies harvesting      After 6 months of healing, implant placement will follow routine surgical protocols as      recommended by the implant manufacturer. Under local anesthesia, a mid-crestal linear      incision and full-thickness flap will be performed with releasing incisions whenever      necessary. Then, with a 16:1 contra-angle attached to a surgical unit and a trephine bur (Ø      3mm), the grafted area correspondent to the 2nd premolar, 1st and 2nd molar regions will be      biopsied at both right and left sides of the maxilla (n=06 sites per patient), guided by a      previously made acrylic resin surgical stent. Bone biopsies will be then divided in two      segments, where one will be stored in 4% formaldehyde solution for histologic analysis and      the other in Eppendorf vials with RNALater for RT-PCR analysis. Then, the sequence of implant      surgical burs as recommended by the manufacturer will be followed for the placement of 6 to 8      implants per patient. Registration of primary stability at insertion will be done by both      manual torque wrench and classified into three groups. A healing abutment will be then      placed, and wound closure will be conducted with non-resorbable suture material A 6-month      one-stage healing protocol will be adopted for all implants.      2.6 - CBCT image analysis      High-resolution CBCT images will be obtained at three different time-points as part of the      treatment protocol, meaning at pre-operative bone graft [baseline], 90 [T1] and 180 [T2] days      (implant placement pre-operative), aiming both pre-op surgical planning and post-op      evaluation of the bone formation. The morphometric bone parameters will be calculated in 3D      analysis according to the recommendations of the American Society for Bone and Mineral      Research (ASBMR) as previously proposed, and statistical analysis will be used to identify      the best parameter combinations aiming to differentiate trabecular bone into three bone      categories: (i) sparse-related to a loose bone structure, (ii) intermediate-related to a      well-structured trabecular bone, and (iii) dense bone types-related to a massive bone area      with little space between the trabeculae.      2.7 - Histologic and histomorphometric analyses      Following removal of graft biopsies at implant placement, bone blocks containing the control      and test bone sites will be shaped and decalcified with 5% HNO3. The blocks will dehydrate in      a graded alcohol series, clarify with xylene and be embedded in resin. Then, the resin will      be polymerised in a UV light chamber for 10h. Using a diamond micro saw, a total of three      3-μm-thick slices from each block will be ground transversely to each specimen long axis at      50, 100, and 150μm from their external portion. After this, routine staining with      hematoxylin-eosin (HE), Azur II and Pararosaniline will be done aiming to differentiate      between HP/β-TCP particles and newly formed bone. Microscopic analysis will be performed at      24X magnification using an optical stereo microscope connected to a digital camera. Image      analysis will be performed using the ImageJ® software.      2.8 - Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)      Following the preparation of the collected graft biopsies for RNA extraction, real-time      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis will be applied to quantify      alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth factor, Osteonectin, Osteopontin and type 1      collagen.

","      This phase I trial tests the feasibility and safety of genetically modified cytotoxic      T-lymphocytes in controlling infections caused by adenovirus (ADV), BK virus (BKV),      cytomegalovirus (CMV), JC virus (JCV), or COVID-19 in immunocompromised patients with cancer.      Viral infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality after hematopoietic stem cell      transplantation, and therapeutic options for these infections are often complicated by      associated toxicities. Genetically modified cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) are designed to      kill a specific virus that can cause infections. Depending on which virus a patient is      infected with (ADV, BKV, CMV, JCV, or COVID-19), the CTLs will be designed to specifically      attack that virus. Giving genetically modified CTLs may help to control the infection.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of administering genetically engineered      glucocorticoid receptor knock out virus specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines in      immunosuppressed cancer patients with viral infections (BKV, JCV, CMV, adenovirus, COVID19).      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:      I. To obtain preliminary data about the efficacy of administering genetically engineered      glucocorticoid receptor knock out virus specific CTL lines in immunosuppressed cancer      patients with viral infections (BKV, JCV, CMV, adenovirus, COVID19).      II. To assess the persistence of the administered cells in the patients. III. To obtain data      about relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).      OUTLINE:      Patients receive virus-specific CTLs intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes. Patients with      partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease may receive up to 8 additional      infusions of virus-specific CTL at least 2 weeks between each infusion.

","      This phase I/II trial investigates the side effects of genetically engineered cells called      FH-MagIC TCR-T cells and how well they work with atezolizumab in treating patients with      triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that has      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). T cells are infection fighting blood cells      that can kill tumor cells. The T cells given in this study will come from the patient and      will have a new gene put in them that makes them able to recognize MAGE-A1, a protein on the      surface of tumor cells. These MAGE-A1-specific T cells may help the body's immune system      identify and kill MAGE-A1 tumor cells. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving FH-MagIC TCR-T cells with atezolizumab may      help treat patients with triple negative breast cancer, urothelial cancer, or non-small cell      lung cancer.    ","      OUTLINE:      This is a phase I, dose escalation study of FH-MagIC TCR-T cells followed by a phase II      study.      LYMPHODEPLETION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and fludarabine IV on      days -4, -3, and -2 before each T-cell infusion.      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive FH-MagIC TCR-T cells IV over 15-20 minutes. Six to twelve      weeks after first T-cell infusion, patients with progressive disease and non-persisting      transgenic TCR T cells may receive a second T-cell infusion.      In the Phase 2 portion of the study, atezolizumab will be administered as standard of care      beginning 24-72 hours after T-cell infusion. Atezolizumab will be given IV every 3 weeks for      at least 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If an      alternative PD1 inhibitor is instead available for a patient, it may be substituted instead.

","      Phase I/Cohort I:      For the Phase I portion of this trial, patients whose malignant gliomas recur after      undergoing initial surgical resection, standard of care radiotherapy (60Gy) and standard of      care temozolomide chemotherapy and who are candidates for, and would bene-fit from, a      surgical debulking. Patients whose tumors have unmethylated MGMT promoters who have completed      radiation therapy will also be eligible, regardless of whether or not they received      temozolomide, since some centers are not using temozolomide in these patients. M032 will      initially be administered directly into the tumor bed at the time of craniotomy and      immediately after resection of the tumor. Patients will be treated with a total dose of 1 x      106 pfu of M032 initially and then subsequently with each dose of Pembrolizumab. If one      toxicity occurs at a given dose level, that cohort will be increased to six patients. If two      or more toxicities occur at the 1 x 106 pfu dose level, then a new cohort will be enrolled at      1 x 105 pfu, using the same approach. If two or more toxicities occur at the 1 x 105 pfu dose      level, then the DSMB will be consulted to determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or      consideration of dose de-escalation to 1 x 104 pfu be considered. The highest safe dose will      be considered the starting dose for      Phase I/Cohort II. Details of initial dose administration of M032. Patients must be      candidates for a resection of the enhancing portion of the recurrent tumor; they will undergo      craniotomy, with additional burr holes as needed, and then stereotactic placement of up to 4      infusion catheters. Planned catheter tip locations will include: a) > 2.5 cm from a cortical      surface; b) > 1 cm from an ependymal surface or the margin of the planned resection cavity;      and c) if possible, > 0.5 cm from a sulcus. This will minimize loss of dose into the      subarachnoid or intra-ventricular space during subsequent M032 inoculations.      Only after catheters have been successfully placed (with Rickham reservoirs used to cap off      cathethers and hold them in place for the remainder of surgery) will patients will then      un-dergo resection of the enhancing portion of the tumor. Subsequent to the resection but      prior to dural closure, M032 will be administered if no ventricular entry has occurred during      the resection. M032 will be administered by by multiple free hand injections into the      resected tumor bed, using approximately equal volumes at each site (6 ml total). Each      inoculation will be administered ~1 cm apart and delivered into the resected tumor bed over 1      minute and at a 1 cm depth (28G, 1/2-inch needle fitted to a 1-cc tuberculin syringe), where      possible. Injections will be placed with careful avoidance of penetration of the ventricular      sys-tem or any significant vascular structures, and any of the already-placed catheters.      Intraoperative ultrasound will be used as needed to define positions of structures or      catheters to avoid. After each inoculation the needle will be left in place for up to two      minutes before removal and, after removal, the entry site will be covered with hemostatic      agent. Both of these measures should minimize reflux of inoculum back into the tumor cavity.      Before closing the dura, a fifth catheter will be left in place and then anchored with a      Rickham in the tumor resection cavity to allow later access for CSF collection. This Rickham      will not be used for M032 administration. The surgical procedure will then be completed in      standard fashion. If ventricular entry has occurred during surgery, no M032 will be      administered intraoperatively. Instead, a post-operative CT scan will be obtained on Day 1,      and the initial M032 dose will be administered as outlined below, using all catheters felt to      be appropriately positioned adjacent to the tumor cavity without violating the constraints of      the exclusion criteria.      Pembrolizumab treatment and subsequent treatments of M032. Starting at week four, patients      will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with intra-venous      infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1). A total of 3      combined doses of Pembrolizumab and M032 will be given. Patients will then undergo treatment      with inoculation of the calculated total dose of M032 as follows: each total dose (1 x 105      pfu for dose level one, 1 x 106 pfu for dose level two) directly into the remaining tumor bed      at the time of craniotomy and immediately after resection for a particular dose level will be      divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of catheters available for      inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of 0.5 ml of M032 and will      be infused over two minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir with a 22-24 g needle      (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the overlying scalp), followed by 0.5      ml of preservative free saline.      Determination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by      the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of      catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns      for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular      reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation. Catheters      whose reservoir(s) are closely associated with overlying scalp infections/inflammation will      not be injected. Each catheter will be gently aspirated after the Rickham has been accessed      but prior to M032 inoculation; catheters from which CSF can be aspirated will not be      inoculated to avoid inoculation into the CSF space. The MRI obtained immediately prior to      assessment (see schedule, below) will be used to help inform the decision-making above. If      there is any question regarding reservoir/catheter suitability, an additional CT or MRI may      be obtained prior to inoculation at the PI's discretion.      Combined Pembrolizumab and M032 treatments at each dose level will be repeated at three-week      intervals for up to three cycles total, or until unacceptable toxicity or tumor progression      occurs. Patients who are responding to treatment may be considered for additional dosing      after the trial period has been completed.      The first two patients treated will not require any waiting period between enrollments. If      one of the two should develop a toxicity, the third and subsequent (up to six) patients at      that level will not be enrolled until seven weeks from the initial dose of M032 and three      weeks from the first combined dose of Pembrolizumab and M032 has transpired for the initial      two patients and every patient thereafter, to allow adequate duration of time for development      of potential dose limiting toxicities in each treated patient before treating the next      patient at that level.      Patients will undergo and then subsequently with each dose of Pembrolizumab; i If one      toxicity occurs at a given dose level, that cohort will be increased to 6 patients. If 2 or      more toxicities occur at the tested dose level, then with the approval of the DSMB, the dose      will be de-escalated by one log and a new cohort enrolled with similar rules at the level. If      2 or more toxicities occur at the de-escalated dose level, then the DSMB will be consulted to      determine if a stopping rule should be invoked or consideration of further dose de-escalation      should be considered. We anticipate as few as four patients (given two or more DLTs      initially) and as many as 12 (only one DLT at each dose level). However, based on experience      with M032 and Pembrolizumab, we expect that this combination will not pro-duce any      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs).      Phase I/Cohort II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction      with Pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent MG, the trial will immediately transition into      a Phase I Cohort II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG.      Patients who are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and      are eligible for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort      trial. As in Phase I Cohort I, for the Phase I/Cohort II, consented subjects will have safe      gross total resection, implantation of up to four Rickham catheters in the peritumoral brain      and M032 injected into the wall of the resection cavity as described above.      Patients will be treated with a total dose of of M032 initially at the time of craniotomy as      determined in Cohort I, above. They will then undergo treatment with standard fractionated      radiation, and temozolomide as determined by treating physician. Starting at week four,      patients will undergo treatment on the same day, and every three weeks thereafter, with      intra-venous infusion of 200mg of Pembrolizumab (for dosing detail, see Section 5.2.1) and      intratumoral M032 (via the Rickham-catheters placed at the periphery of the tumor cavity-the      catheter left in the tumor cavity itself will not be used for M032 inoculation, but only to      access CSF). Patients will then undergo treatment with inoculation of the calculated total      dose of M032 for that dose level divided into up to four aliquots depending on the number of      catheters available for inoculation. Each aliquot will be 1ml in total volume, consisting of      0.5 ml of M032 and will be infused over 2 minutes after puncture of each individual reservoir      with a 22-24 g needle (using sterile techniques, after sterile preparation of the over-lying      scalp).      Determination of the suitability of each reservoir/catheter for inoculation will be made by      the PI before each dosing and will include known patency status of each catheter, location of      catheter tip and degree of adherence to the placement guidelines described above; 3) concerns      for associated neurotoxicity related to M032 and/or inflammation in area of a particular      reservoir/catheter tip; and 4) availability of other catheters for inoculation.

Phase II: Having established for the safety and tolerability of M032 in conjunction with      Pembrolizumab in patients with newly-diagnosed MG, the trial will immediately transition into      a Phase II study of Pembrolizumab and M032 in patients with newly diagnosed MG. Patients who      are previously untreated but suspected of having a high grade glioma by MRI and are eligible      for craniotomy and resection will be offered participation in this two-Cohort trial. Dosing      will be administered using the RP2D established in the Phase I/Cohort II and administered      using the same regimen and schedule. However, unlike the Phase I, patients will be eligible      to receive Pembrolizumab and M032 every 3 weeks for up to one year. The Phase II design will      employ the Simon two-stage optimal study design. It will be a single-arm open-label study of      M032+ pembrolizumab and the primary endpoints of Over-all Survival at 12 months and 24      months, and Progression Free Survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6). We will use the iRANO      criteria for MRI-defined changes indicative of pseudopro-gression, suggesting a beneficial      inflammatory immune response. In the first stage, 6 patients will be accrued. Data will be      allowed to mature, and an interim analysis per-formed at that time. During this period,      additional subjects may be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer responses in the initial 6      patients, further accrual to the study may be stopped. Otherwise, 10 additional patients will      be accrued for a total of 16. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more responses      are observed in 16 patients. This design yields a type I error rate of 0.05 and power of 80%      when the PFS6 is 75%. To allow for 25% unevaluable subjects, a maximum of 22 subjects will be      enrolled.    ",,"

","Overall Survival at 12 and 24 months and Progression Free Survival at 6 months (PFS-6)6-24 monthsOverall Survival at 12 and 24 months allows for a quantifiable outcome that should be straightforward to compare to historical data in this patient population. PFS-6 evaluates all treated patients at 6 months after baseline MRI and determines the percentage of patients who have not progressed by either imaging or neurologic evaluation. The iRA-NO criteria will be utilized to determine progression for this trial. PFS-6 will also be com-pared to historical controls for each cohort., Overall Survival (OS) and Progression Free Survival (PFS)3 yearsOS will be determined for each cohort of patients and compared to historical controls for that cohort. PFS will be determined by MRI and neurologic evaluation using the iRANO criteria. PFS utilizes an historical approach to determining if progression has occurred and is helpful measure to compare this current study to historical studies. An im-portant limitation in the assessment of PFS centers on the fact that patients may not get im-aging or neurologic examinations done at an optimal or consistent time; as such, another approach, PFS-6, has been adopted in some studies. PFS-6 evaluates all treated patients at 6 months after baseline MRI and determines the percentage of patients who have not pro-gressed by either imaging or neurologic evaluation. The iRANO criteria will be utilized to determine progression for this trial. PFS and OS will be compared to historical controls for each cohort.",,"

Prior therapy: Patients must have failed external beam radio-therapy to the brain, and if        eligible and tolerated, undergone appropriate treatment with temozolomide chemotherapy. All        radiation and additional chemotherapies must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to        enrollment. Prior therapy with nitrosoureas must have been completed at least 6 weeks prior        to enrollment.        Phase I/Cohort II or Phase II: Participants are eligible to be included in the study only        if all of the following criteria apply:        Patient must have MRI findings consistent with probable malignant glioma, have no previous        diagnosis of glioma, and have had either no history of any surgery for brain tumor. The        exception to this requirement is that patients who have under-gone biopsy for diagnosis        only and have not received any other treatment. All patients must be potential candidates        for resection of the probably malignant glioma tumor.        Should a patient in Phase I/Cohort II or Phase II be found on final pathologic diagnosis to        not have a glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma, he/she will        receive no other doses of M032 other than that administered at the time of craniotomy, nor        will he/she receive any doses of Pembrolizumab. He/she will be followed for evidence of        toxicity of M032 only and will be considered off-study for all efficacy and other secondary        endpoints.        All newly diagnosed patients, whether in Phase I/Cohort II or Phase II shall also be        required to meet the following eligibility and be subject to the exclusion criteria below:          1. Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the             use of M032 in patients <16 years of age, children are excluded from this study but             will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.          2. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥70% (see Appendix B).          3. Life expectancy of greater than 4 weeks.          4. Preoperatively, the lesion must be ≥1.0 cm in diameter as determined by MRI.          5. The effects of M032 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women             of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to             study entry and for six months after re-ceiving the final dose of M032. Because it is             currently unknown if M032 can be transmitted by sexual contact, a barrier method of             birth control must be employed and for six (6) months following the administration of             the last dose of this study drug. Should a woman become pregnant while participating             in this study, she should inform her treating physician im-mediately. Subjects should             also refrain from donating blood during the trial.          6. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed con-sent             document.          7. Females of childbearing potential must not be pregnant; this will be con-firmed by a             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days prior to start-ing study treatment.        Steroid use is allowed as long as dose has not increased within 2 weeks of scheduled M032        administration. Whenever possible, the patient should be on a steroid dose that is        equivalent to a dexamethasone dose of ≤ 2mg daily at the time of treatment.        Exclusion Criteria:        A Woman of Child Bearing Potential (WOCBP) who has a positive urine pregnancy test within        72 hours prior to allocation.(see Appendix 3).

","      This is a Phase I study to evaluate the safety profile of a type of immune therapy called      HER2 CAR T cells (short for HER2 chimeric antigen receptor T cells). In addition to looking      for side effects, we will study how well this treatment works against a brain tumor called      ependymoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent) or has not responded well to      treatment (progressive) in children. The HER2 CAR T cells used in this trial are made from      the patient's own blood. A new gene, called the HER2 CAR, will be inserted into patient's T      cells to allow them recognize a protein on the tumor called HER2. These HER2-specific CAR T      cells may be able to target and kill ependymoma tumors that express HER2. This research is      also studying how doable it is to provide this type of CAR T cell treatment to children being      treated at different hospitals.    ","      PBTC-059 is a multicenter, Phase I and Surgical study of the treatment HER2-specific CAR T      cells for patients with refractory or recurrent ependymoma.      Phase I      The primary objectives of the Phase I study are to determine the safety of intravenous      injection of HER2-specific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and to evaluate      the multicenter feasibility of administering up to three infusions of HER2-CAR T cells after      lymphodepletion.      Patients will receive one infusion of HER2psecific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting      chemotherapy. Following recovery from their first treatment (no earlier than 8 weeks and no      later than 12 weeks), patients will resume treatment with HER2-specific CAR T cells for up to      2 infusions after lymphodepleting chemotherapy if they meet laboratory parameters.      The length of time on study for patients enrolled on the Phase I study is anticipated to be 9      months on treatment. Patients will then be followed for 15 years after treatment.      Surgical Study      The objective of the Surgical study is to evaluate the post-treatment tumor tissue for      presence of HER2-specific CAR T cells administered intravenously in children undergoing      surgical resection. The surgical study will be initiated following completion of the safety      evaluation period of 6 patients treated in the Phase I study.      Once the surgical study is open for enrollment, all patients who have clinical indication for      surgery, except those needing urgent surgery, will be eligible for enrollment to the surgical      study. Patients will receive one infusion of HER2-specific CAR T cells after lymphodepleting      chemotherapy 4-6 weeks before surgical resection of their tumor, at which time samples will      be taken for analysis. Following recovery from surgery (no earlier than 8 weeks and no later      than 15 weeks), patients will resume treatment with HER2-specific CAR T cells for up to 2      infusions if they meet laboratory parameters.      The first patient in the surgical study will complete a 6-week safety evaluation period prior      to enrollment of the subsequent patient. The length of time on study for patients enrolled on      the Surgical study is anticipated to be 10 months on treatment. Patients will then be      followed for 15 years after treatment.      Dosing      All patients on Phase I and Surgical study will receive HER2 CAR T cells at a      patient-specific dose level 1 (8x10^7 CAR-positive T cells/m^2) for infusion. The cell dose      will be based on the patient weight and height obtained by the treating institution at the      time of procurement. For patients whose BMI is greater than 95th percentile for given age and      sex, the Body surface area (BSA) will be calculated using the ideal body weight.      In the event that dose level 1 is found to have excessive toxicity, three additional doses of      CAR T cells at dose level -1 (5x10^7 CAR-positive T cells/m^2) will be made to be used in the      event that dose de-escalation occurs before a patient is enrolled for treatment.

This would specifically include the feasibility of manufacturing the cells at one center and shipping them to other sites for administration and the infusion process. If more than 25% of patients cannot be treated as intended due to manufacturing, shipping or administration related causes (jointly considered as feasibility criteria), this would be considered unacceptable. If the treatment is not delivered as intended due to one or more manufacturing, shipping, or administration related causes, this instance will be counted as feasibility failure for that subject.","

","        Criteria for Screening          1. Tumor             Patient must have a diagnosis of ependymoma that is recurrent or progressive. All             tumors must have histologic verification either at the time of diagnosis or             recurrence.          2. Prior Therapy             Patient must have received standard of care therapy including maximal safe surgical             resection followed by local adjuvant radiation therapy prior to enrollment.          3. Adequate Pre-trial Tumor Tissue             Patient must have adequate pre-trial tumor material available to determine HER2             status. Tumor tissue from the most recent resection or biopsy of recurrent disease in             preferred. If unavailable, tumor tissue from prior recurrences or from the time of             initial diagnosis is acceptable.             a. One exception will be patients who have previously received HER2-directed therapy             (including but not limited to trastuzumab); these patients will need evaluation of             tumor HER2 status after stopping treatment due to the possibility of HER2             downregulation or loss.             Tumor biopsy will not be performed for the purpose of HER2 screening. Patients will             not be eligible for screening on PBTC-059 if tumor tissue is not available or             inadequate for HER2 testing. Tumor screening by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be             done centrally using the testing method validated at Texas Children's Hospital. Sample             for screening must be shipped within 7 days of enrollment for screening.          4. Known HIV Positivity             Patients that are known to be HIV-positive are ineligible due to the unknown safety             and efficacy of infusing these patients with CAR T cells genetically modified using             retroviral vectors.

Surgical Study (Stratum 2) - Patients with measurable disease (Section 3.3.1.2.1) in             whom tumor resection is clinically indicated and feasible after the CAR T cell             infusion.          3. Age             Patient must be ≥ 1 but ≤ 22 years of age at the time of enrollment for treatment.          4. HER2 CAR T cell product             The patient must have, at a minimum, one prescribed dose of the cryopreserved,             autologous HER2 CAR T cell product available for infusion.          5. Prior Anti-neoplastic Therapy             Cytotoxic chemotherapy: Patients must not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy for at             least 28 days prior to study enrollment for treatment and must have recovered from the             acute treatment related toxicities (defined as < grade 1 if not defined in eligibility             criteria; excludes alopecia) prior to entering this study.             Biological, targeted, or investigational agents (anti-neoplastic): Patients must have             a period of at least 28 days from the last receipt of said drug and must have             recovered from all acute toxic effects.               1. For agents that have known acute adverse events occurring beyond 28 days after                  administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during which adverse                  events are known to occur.             Monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, and other agents with known prolonged             half-lives: Patient must have recovered from any acute toxicity potentially related to             the agent and received their last dose of the agent ≥ 28 days prior to study             enrollment.             Adoptive cellular therapies: Patient must have recovered from any acute toxicity             potentially related to the cellular product and received their last dose of the             cellular product at least 90 days prior to study enrollment. (Note: Patients who have             previously received an adoptive cellular therapy may continue long-term follow up             evaluations per the prior study's evaluation schedule as needed for assessment of             long-term toxicities including genotoxicity.)             Radiation: Patients must have had their last fraction of:             a. Craniospinal irradiation, whole brain radiation, total body irradiation or             radiation to >50% of pelvis or spine ≥ 3 months prior to enrollment (90 days) prior to             enrollment.             b. Focal palliative irradiation to the tumor ≥ 42 days prior to enrollment. c.             Patients who receive tumor-directed radiation (non-palliative) should have confirmed             disease progression on the imaging study done at least 6 weeks after the completion of             the last fraction of radiation.             Surgery: Patients must have not had surgery within 14 days of enrollment for treatment             and must have adequate wound healing and recovered from other acute effects from             surgery. One exception is the placement of central venous catheter which will be             allowed at any time point until treatment initiation on the study.          6. Growth Factors             Patients must be off all colony-forming growth factor(s) for at least 7 days prior to             enrollment (e.g., filgrastim, sargramostim, or erythropoietin). 14 days must have             elapsed if the patient received a long-acting formulation.          7. Corticosteroids             Patients who are receiving systemic corticosteroids must be on a stable or decreasing             dose for at least 14 days prior to enrollment for treatment, and corticosteroid dose             must be less than or equal to dexamethasone 0.5 mg/m2/day (or equivalent) during the             14 days preceding enrollment. Use of topical, ocular, intranasal, or inhaled             corticosteroids are permitted.          8. Neurologic Status             In patients with neurological deficits, deficits should be stable for a minimum of 7             days prior to enrollment. A baseline detailed neurological exam should clearly             document the neurological status of the patient at the time of enrollment for             treatment on the study.             Patients with seizure disorders may be enrolled if seizures are well controlled.          9. Performance Status             Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS for > 16 years of age) or Lansky Performance Score             (LPS for ≤ 16 years of age) (Appendix C) assessed within one week of enrollment must             be ≥ 60%. Patients who are unable to walk because of neurologic deficits, but who are             up in a wheelchair, will be considered ambulatory for the purpose of assessing the             performance score.         10. Organ Function             Patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined in Section             3.2.1.4.         11. Pregnancy Prevention             Patients of childbearing or child fathering potential must be willing to use a             medically acceptable form of birth control, which includes abstinence, while being             treated on this study.         12. Informed Consent        The patient or parent/guardian can understand the consent and is willing to sign a written        informed consent document according to institutional guidelines. Age- and developmentally        appropriate assent should be obtained as required by institutional guidelines.          1. Patients who meet eligibility criteria per Section 3.3.1.2.1 must be enrolled using             Phase I treatment consent (Stratum 1).          2. Patients who meet eligibility criteria per Section 3.3.1.2.2 must be enrolled using             Surgical Study treatment consent (Stratum 2).        Treatment Exclusion Criteria          1. Patients with Bulky Tumors on Imaging Studies             Bulky tumors will be defined as those:               1. > 6 cm in single maximum dimension, or               2. tumor causing uncal herniation or mass effect leading to midline shift with or                  without symptoms or signs of impending herniation or               3. obstruction to Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow.          2. Infratentorial tumors with symptoms or signs arising from brain stem involvement by             the tumor. Patients with stable cranial nerve deficit(s) secondary to prior surgery             will not be excluded.          3. Surgical Study (Stratum 2): Patients who have urgent need for surgical resection of             tumor.          4. Pregnancy or Breast-feeding        Pregnant women or nursing mothers are excluded from this study.        a. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy        test within 7 days of start of enrollment for treatment. If the urine test is positive or        cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.        Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because there is an unknown        but potential risk of adverse events to the fetus or the nursing infant with the use of T        cells genetically modified to express HER2 CAR. Pre-clinical studies in mice demonstrate        the target antigen HER2 is necessary for normal fetal development of cardiac trabeculae,        cranial sensory ganglia, and motor neuron development.75 Additionally, the lymphodepleting        chemotherapy drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide are both Pregnancy Class D drugs.        4. Concurrent Illness        Patients with active autoimmune disease, documented history of autoimmune disease/syndrome,        or any other condition that requires ongoing systemic steroids or systemic        immunosuppressive agents, except a. Patients with vitiligo or resolved asthma/atopy b.        Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjogren's syndrome c.        Patients requiring physiologic doses of corticosteroids (up to 0.5 mg/m2/day dexamethasone        equivalent)        History of or ongoing pneumonitis or significant interstitial lung disease        Ongoing or active uncontrolled infection        Patients with any clinically significant unrelated systemic illness (serious infections or        significant cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or other organ dysfunction), that in the opinion of        the investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate protocol therapy, put        them at additional risk for toxicity or would interfere with the study procedures or        results.        Patients with any of the following cardiac diseases          1. New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III or IV          2. Clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia including, but not limited to, Torsade de             pointes or requiring a pacemaker          3. Left ventricular ejection fraction below 50% as determined by echocardiography (ECHO)        Known HIV positivity        a. HIV-positive patients are ineligible due to the unknown safety and efficacy of infusing        these patients with CAR T cells genetically modified using retroviral vectors.        Additionally, the immunosuppression used for treatment in this study will pose an        unacceptable risk.        5. Concomitant Medications        Patients who are receiving any other anti-cancer or investigational drug therapy are        ineligible.        Patients who have received the last vaccination of a live vaccine ≤ 30 days prior to        enrollment are ineligible.          1. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles,             mumps, rubella, varicella, yellow fever, rabies, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), and             typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g.,             Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines and must meet timeline for live vaccine.        Herbal preparations/medications (except for vitamins) including, but not limited to: St.        John's wort, Kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),        yohimbe, saw palmetto, black cohosh, and ginseng. Patients should stop using all herbal        medications and dietary supplements at least 7 days prior to enrollment.        6. Inability to participate        Patients who in the opinion of the investigator are unwilling or unable to return for        required follow-up visits or obtain follow-up studies required to assess toxicity to        therapy or to adhere to drug administration plan, other study procedures, and study        restrictions.        7. Allergy        Patients with a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical        or biologic composition (murine protein-containing products, Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or        dextran 40).

","      This is a first-in-human clinical trial to test whether a protein administered into the brain      continuously by gene therapy, Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), will slow or prevent      cell loss in the brains of people affected by Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive      Impairment. The protein may also activate cells in the brain that have not yet deteriorated.      Gene therapy refers to the use of a harmless virus to have brain cells make the potentially      protective protein, BDNF.    ","      This is an open label Phase I clinical trial of AAV2-BDNF gene therapy for early Alzheimer's      Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in 12 participants.      BDNF is a nervous system growth factor that regulates neuronal function in key memory      circuits of the brain (the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). BDNF reduces cell loss,      stimulates cell function, and builds new connections (synapses) between brain cells in animal      models.      This clinical trial will use techniques of gene therapy because the candidate therapeutic      protein, BDNF, does not cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Two previous clinical programs      of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) gene therapy for AD and Neurturin gene therapy for Parkinson's      disease in over 120 patients provided evidence that degenerating neurons respond to growth      factors with classic ""trophic"" responses in the human brain.      Participants will undergo one gene transfer procedure. Thus, dosing is performed only once,      and repeat dosing or daily medications are not expected to be required.      12 participants will be enrolled in this Phase I trial, 6 with early AD and 6 with MCI.

CD19 targeted CAR T Cell Therapy
This is a personalized therapeutic approach that entails removal of T cells from patient's peripheral blood, genetic modification, activation and expansion in vitro to retarget cells against CD19 protein on the surface of B cells, and infusion of the genetically engineered cells back into the patient. CD19 is a surface protein that is expressed on B cells starting from early pre-B cells to mature fully differentiated B cells. Therefore, CD19-targeted CAR T cell therapy can effectively treat refractory B cell lymphomas.

This exclusion is included for two reasons.             First, there is evidence of decreased marrow reserve in HIV+ patients and antiviral             treatment is associated with myelosuppression. Thus, drug treatment designed to be             myelosuppressive may bemore toxic in this patient population. Second, extensive             laboratory culturing of the bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells is             required. No preclinical samples which are HIV+ have been evaluated with the gene             transfer modality proposed and thus the feasibility and safety of gene transfer and             selection in HIV+ samples cannot yet be advocated. Such studies are planned so as to             not preclude HIV+ patients in later studies.          -  Pregnant or lactating women. There is data to indicate that BCNU and TMZ is             teratogenic and carcinogenic. Thus, its use in pregnant women would confer unnecessary             risk to the fetus.          -  Patients with symptomatic pulmonary disease and other severe co-morbid respiratory             conditions, including patients with active pulmonary infection and/or pulse oximetry <             90% and a corrected DLCO < 50% of predicted.

","      This study is a prospective, single center phase II clinical trial in which patients with      Severe Aplastic Anemia (SAA) ) will receive a haploidentical transplantation. The purpose of      this study is to learn more about newer methods of transplanting blood forming cells donated      by a family member that is not fully matched to the patient. This includes studying the      effects of the chemotherapy, radiation, the transplanted cell product and additional white      blood cell (lymphocyte) infusions on the patient's body, disease and overall survival. The      primary objective is to assess the rate of engraftment at 30 days and overall survival (OS)      and event free survival (EFS) at 1 year post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).      Primary Objectives        -  To estimate the rate of engraftment at 30 days after TCR αβ+ T-cell-depleted graft           infusion in patients receiving a single dose of post graft infusion cyclophosphamide.        -  To estimate the overall survival and event free survival at 1-year post transplantation.      Secondary Objectives        -  To calculate the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD after HCT.        -  To calculate the rate of secondary graft rejection at 1-year post transplantation        -  To calculate the cumulative incidence of viral reactivation (CMV, EBV and adenovirus).        -  To describe the immune reconstitution after TCR αβ+ T-cell-depleted graft infusion at 1           month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year.      Exploratory Objectives        -  To longitudinally assess the phenotype and epigenetic profile of T-cells in SAA patients           receiving HCT for SAA.        -  To assess the phenotype and epigenetic profile of T-cells in DLI administered to SAA           patients post HCT.        -  To longitudinally assess CD8 T cell differentiation status in SAA patients using an           epigenetic atlas of human CD8 T cell differentiation.        -  To examine the effector functions and proliferative capacity of CD8 T cells isolated           from SAA patients before and after DLI.        -  Quantify donor derived Treg cells at different time points in patients received HCT.        -  Determine Treg activation status at different stages after HCT.        -  Are specific features of the DLI product associated with particular immune repertoire           profiles post-transplant?        -  How does the diversity and functional profile of the DLI product alter the response to           pathogens in the recipient?        -  Do baseline features of the recipient's innate and adaptive immune cells correlate with           post-transplant immune repertoires and response profiles?    ","      Immunosuppressant therapy (IST) is the main treatment for SAA for patients who do not have an      HLA-matched sibling donor available for transplant. But some patients with SAA do not respond      to IST and some others relapse after IST. HCT using an unrelated but HLA-matched donor is the      only curative option for these patients but many patients lack a suitable HLA-matched donor.      St Jude is trying to increase donor options for these patients by using novel therapeutic      strategies by combining two widely used of GVHD prophylaxis methods: i) selective T cell      depletion and ii) use of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. This will allow expansion of the      donor pool to include haploidentical donors as well as reduce the risk of GVHD. The goal of      this protocol is to test whether combining these GVHD prophylaxis approaches will allow use      of haploidentical donors, reduce risk of GVHD, reduce transfusion dependence and improve      immune reconstitution.      For this study chemotherapy, antibodies and radiation will be given to prepare the body to      receive donor cells. Participants will then be given the donor cell infusion.      Patients will receive two types of donor blood cell products - a progenitor blood cell      infusion and then a donor lymphocyte infusion. Both the progenitor blood cell and the donor      lymphocyte infusion will be processed in a laboratory at St. Jude using a machine called the      CliniMACS™.      In this clinical trial, participants will receive a special type of progenitor blood cells      (called TCRαβ- depleted blood cells) from the donor.      After the donor progenitor cells have started to grow within the body (engraftment),      participants will receive a second product that contains mature immune cells. These immune      cells called CD45RA-depleted lymphocytes or donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) will help fight      infections in the body after the transplant and strengthen the developing immune system.

",      The overall objective of the investigators is to assess the therapeutic efficacy and      tolerability of Allogeneic Bone Marrow Derived Multipotent Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)      isolated from hematogenous bone marrow for treatment of treatment-resistant bipolar      depression patient (TRBD).    ,"      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aiming to study      the efficacy and side effects of MSCs adjunctive to TAU compared to a normal saline solution      in patients with TRBD. Relevant patients with bipolar depression will be addressed in order      to establish whether they are willing to be screened for the study. The patients must be      assigned a patient number and sign the consent form after receiving oral and written      information about the study prior to undergoing any study procedures.      MSCs will be infused as a single dose up to one week after the inclusion of the patient. The      treatment trial lasts eight weeks. Of note, the investigators will assess patients also at      week 26 with a neurocognitive and clinical battery. It will not be allowed changes in      psychiatric medication during this period. If a patient or the treating clinician decides      that the patient could receive better treatment outside of the study, the patient may leave      the study at all times, as specified in the informed consent. Patients were not allowed to      take nonsteroidal or steroidal anti-inflammatory medications during the study. Medications      for hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism, allergies, infections, or other medical      conditions were allowed as dictated by the patients' treating physicians. The investigators      defined refractory bipolar depression as depression that failed to respond to two trials      (during lifetime) with antidepressants and/or mood stabilizer with proven efficacy in bipolar      depression (lithium, lamotrigine, quetiapine, lurasidone, olanzapine) in adequate doses for      at least 6 weeks or until cessation of treatment due to side effects (Schoeyen et al., 2015).      After the initial injection, patients will continue maintenance treatment with their current      psychiatrist. During this time, they will not receive additional injections but will receive      treatment as usual per their clinician's choice. Patients will remain on stable psychiatric      medications during this period. If patients need to change medications, they will be removed      from the study protocol.    ",,"

","Change in depression as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)baseline, week 8, week 26The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is a short and reliable scale devised to be sensitive to change. Patients are rated on ten items, each of which has value ranges from 0 (the least pathology) to 6 (the most sever pathology). Sum scores range from 0 to 60, with a scoring of 20 indicating moderate and 30 severe depression. The scale is sensitive to change and covers many, but not all, symptom domains in depression.","
Change in Functional impairment as assessed by the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST)
baseline, week 26
The Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) assesses functional impairment. FAST is a 24-item scale and assesses six functional domains: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive, financial issues, interpersonal relationships, and leisure time. Higher scores indicate higher degrees of functional impairment.

baseline, week 26
The Clinical Global Impression Scale for bipolar lllness (CGI-BP) is a modification of the CGI specifically for use in assessing global illness severity and change in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The revised scale and manual provide a focused set of instructions to facilitate the reliability of these ratings of mania, depression, and overall bipolar illness during treatment of an acute episode or in longer-term illness prophylaxis. The clinician forms a global judgment both of the severity of the illness as compared to other cases with the same diagnosis and the global degree of change during treatment. There are 3 subscales (severity of mania, severity of depression, severity overall); and each subscale has a range of values from 1 (best) to 7 (worst).

Change in problem-solving ability as assessed by the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)
baseline, week 26
The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) assesses problem-solving ability and is thought to be an index of functioning of the prefrontal cortex. The task requires subjects to match cards to one of four target cards according to a certain sorting rule (color, shape or number) without explicit instructions regarding the nature of the sorting rule. After 10 consecutive matches, the sorting rule changes without warning, and the subject needs to determine the new principle. Perseverative errors and number of categories achieved will be used as dependent measures.

",      This study plans to enroll 10 patients aged 13-17 years of age with refractory perianal      fistulizing disease. Patients will be treated by direct injection to the fistula tract(s)      with 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again      after 3 months if not completely healed.    ,"      Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic transmural inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal      tract, continues to increase in incidence for unknown reasons. According to population based      studies, at least 26% of patients with CD will develop perianal fistulas in the first two      decades following diagnosis, particularly those with colonic and rectal involvement. These      patients experience significant morbidity due to pain, persistent drainage, recurrent      perianal sepsis, and ongoing need to access medical care resulting in increased costs and      impaired quality of life. Onset of Crohn's disease in childhood is associated with even more      aggressive perianal fistula development, with fistulas occurring in as many as 20-31% of      children within 5-7 years after Crohn's disease diagnosis. Based on national estimates of      pediatric Crohn's disease prevalence, this suggests that there are more than 10,000 children      with perianal fistulas due to Crohn's disease in the United States.      This study plans to enroll 10 patients (aged 13-17 years) with refractory perianal      fistulizing disease. The next step in management for these patients would be a mucosal tissue      flap, temporary stoma, or proctectomy with permanent ostomy.      Patients will be treated by direct injection of 75 million allogeneic bone marrow derived      mesenchymal stem cells at baseline and again after 3 months if not completely healed.      Patients will be followed for a total of 12 months post initial injection.    ",,"

",      The protocol is a phase I open label study evaluating the safety and feasibility of      peri-transplant infusion of freshly expanded interferon gamma primed MSCs in adult and      pediatric patients undergoing HCT for acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).    ,"      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an established therapeutic modality for high risk      hematological malignancies in adults and children. The primary cause of morbidity and      mortality after HCT is graft versus host disease (GVHD), affecting up to 70% of patients even      with current prophylaxis and directly accounting for approximately a third of regimen-related      death. Currently, pharmacologic prophylaxis consists of a calcineurin inhibitor and      methotrexate, a drug combination introduced around 40 years ago. Despite this regimen being      recognized as the standard of care, it is only partially effective, increases the risk of      infection and disease relapse and imparts drug-related, short- and long-term adverse effects.      Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have potent immune modulatory activity which is markedly      enhanced by exposure to interferon γ. In murine models, interferon γ (IFNγ) primed MSCs      (γMSCs) potently suppress GVHD without untoward adverse effects suggesting this cell therapy      may markedly reduce the regimen related toxicity of HCT; however γMSCs have never been      infused into patients.      This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that freshly expanded γMSCs can be reliably      produced and safely infused into patients undergoing HCT as GVHD prophylaxis.      This is an investigator-initiated Phase I study using a rolling 6, dose escalation design      with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual to the      pediatric tier will commence after the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined in      adults. A successful outcome of this study will lay the foundation for a future Phase II      study to demonstrate efficacy and support a Phase III randomized trial.      The researchers plan to enroll a minimum of 4 and maximum of 45 subjects who are greater than      1 year old. Participants will be followed for up to 2 years after the HCT. The study will be      conducted at Emory University and will recruit participants from the Winship Cancer Institute      and Children's Hospital in Atlanta at Egleston.    ",,"
Non-Randomized
Sequential Assignment
This study uses a rolling 6 dose escalation design with two independently accruing expansion cohorts: adults and pediatrics. Accrual in the pediatric tier will commence after the maximum dose tolerated has been determined in adults.
Treatment
None (Open Label)
","Number of successful preparations and deliveries of investigational productDay 1 (day of infusion)Feasibility will be documented by successful γMSC preparation and delivery to the bedside. If an adverse event precludes initiation or completion of the infusion, this MSC preparation/infusion will, nonetheless, be considered feasible. Processing scored as a not feasible will consist of a cell preparation does not meet release criteria., Number of adverse events attributed to the investigational productDay 2 (day after infusion)Safety will be assessed by toxicity grading according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4 (CTCAEv4). All recorded adverse events and serious adverse events will be documented and recorded. Their attribution to γMSCs will be determined. Dose limiting toxicity definition: For this study, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be defined as any grade ≥3 adverse reaction AND attributable to γMSCs (attribution listed as at least probable), occurring from γMSC infusion through the day of hematopoietic engraftment or 21 days of transplant, whichever is later., Maximal Tolerated DoseDay 2 (day after infusion)The maximal tolerated dose will be the dose at which 0 of 3 or 1 of 6 subjects demonstrates a DLT. If a dose of 10 x 106 γMSCs/kg is determined to be safe, then we will not determine the true MTD and accept 10 x 106 γMSCs/kg as the maximal dose.","
Primary graft failure
Up to Year 2
This endpoint will be defined as lack of neutrophil recovery (defined as ANC > 500/μL for three consecutive days) by 42 days post-transplant or neutrophil recovery with lack of myeloid donor chimerism. Relapse and death prior to neutrophil engraftment are considered competing risks for the endpoint of primary graft failure.
,
Secondary graft failure
Up to Year 2
Secondary graft failure is defined as initial donor-derived neutrophil engraftment followed by subsequent decline in ANC to < 500/μL for fourteen consecutive measurements on different days, and unresponsive to growth factor therapy, with loss of donor chimerism to < 50%.
,
Platelet engraftment
Up to Year 2
Platelet engraftment is defined as the first day of a minimum of three consecutive measurements on different days such that the patient has achieved a platelet count > 20,000/μL and > 50,000/μL with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. The first day of the three measurements will be designated as the day of platelet engraftment.
,
Non-relapse mortality (NRM)
Up to Year 2
The event is death in continuous remission treating relapse as the competing risk. Patients alive and in remission at the time of last observation will be censored.
,
Change in Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGvHD) Incidence
Day 30, Day 100
Incidences of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GvHD will be measured according to Revised Glucksberg criteria.
,
Change in Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) Incidence
Day 30, Day 100, Day 180, Day 365
Incidence of chronic GvHD will be scored according to the recent NIH scoring.
,
Disease-free survival (DFS)
Up to Year 2
Disease-free survival is defined as the minimum time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease, to death or to last follow-up.
,
Primary cause of death
Up to Year 2
Primary cause of death will be classified as:
Relapse/Primary disease: If the patient relapsed/progressed after day 0 prior to death, the primary cause of death is relapse/progression, even if they subsequently developed GvHD, organ toxicities or infections that may have contributed to subsequent death. GvHD: Death from acute or chronic GvHD, in the absence of relapse or disease progression.
Infection: Death from documented viral, bacterial or fungal infections in the absence of GvHD or relapse/disease progression.
Organ toxicity: Death from major organ toxicities not attributable to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/MDS, infection or GvHD.
Other: Any other causes of death.
,
Relapse
Up to Year 2
Testing for recurrent malignancy in the blood, marrow or other sites will be used to assess relapse after transplantation. For the purpose of this study, relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of AML, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or MDS and including minimal residual disease (MRD) in ALL consistent with pre-transplant features. The event for this endpoint is the time interval from transplant to relapse/recurrence of disease or to last follow-up. Death in remission is considered a competing risk.
,
Early discontinuation
Up to Year 2
If a patient is enrolled on the study but does not start protocol treatment, a study exit form must be submitted documenting the reason for not starting protocol treatment. Such a subject will not be considered evaluable.
,
Viral activation
Up to Day 100
Viral activations of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) will be documented. For the purpose of the study viral activation is defined as any polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay result considered positive by Laboratory Medicine which may or may not lead to the initiation of antiviral therapy as per institutional guidelines.
","
Drug
Interferon gamma (IFNγ)-primed human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells
To determine the maximal dose, initially adult subjects will receive a single infusion of third party, freshly ex vivo expanded, IFNγ-primed MSCs at a dose of 2 x 106 cells/kg of ideal body weight on Day +1 (the day after infusion of the hematopoietic cell graft). The dose will be escalated to 5 x 106 and then 10 x 106 cells/kg. In absence of any dose limiting toxicity, 10 x 106 cells/kg will be accepted as the maximal dose.
Subsequent participants in the adult and pediatric cohorts will receive the maximal dose as determined by the initial adult participants.
Participants will receive the infusion in an inpatient setting. MSCs will be intravenously infused through a central line or a large bore peripheral IV using standard blood product tubing within 4 hours of release. The product will be infused by IV push or syringe pump over 5 -15 minutes.

","      This clinical trial is an open, single-center, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety      of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell injection in patients with chronic      kidney disease.      The purpose is to evaluate the safety for 12 months after administration of Cellgram-CKD 3      times in 10 patients with chronic kidney disease.    ","      The screening test is performed after the clinical trial subject consents in writing to      participate in the clinical trial.      Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are registered in the clinical trial, and      Cellgram-CKD is injected intravenously by puncturing a vein with a needle. After injecting      Cellgram-CKD three times at an interval of 2 weeks (14 days), the subject visits the testing      institution at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months for safety evaluation.      However, since the safety of Cellgram-CKD has not been established, proceed as follows.      In the first 3 subjects who received the investigational product, if no adverse events of      Grade 3 or higher according to the NCI-CTCAE related to the investigational product occur 14      days after the 1st and 2nd administration, and 1 month after the 3rd administration, the      remaining subjects were sequentially treated. Register as a member and conduct clinical      trials.      If an adverse event of Grade 3 or higher according to the NCI-CTCAE standard related to the      test drug occurs in two of the first three subjects, the clinical trial is terminated early.      is conducted by registering three additional test subjects in the same way as the first.      If one or more of the three subjects develops a Grade 3 or higher adverse event related to      the investigational product, the clinical trial is terminated early, and the remaining      subjects are treated only if all three subjects do not have a Grade 3 or higher adverse      reaction related to the investigational product.

",      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and efficacy of PSORI-CM01      formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic AD-MSCs in patients with      moderate to severe psoriasis. And it explores the expectations of patients for the treatment      of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their expectations to      participate in this study. The trial would provide preliminary data for large sample clinical      randomized controlled trials.    ,"      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to      find new treatment for psoriasis.      As current experience and cases of AD-MSCs in the treatment of psoriasis are still relatively      small, and it is unknown about their safety and efficacy combined with traditional medicine      in the treatment of psoriasis.      This study designed a randomized controlled trial to compare PSORI-CM01 formula vs Guben      Huayu formula combined with expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the      treatment of psoriasis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and      efficacy of PSORI-CM01 formula vs Gu Ben Hua Yu formula combined with Expanded Allogeneic      AD-MSCs in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. And it also aims to determine the      feasibility and the potential of the protocol for the full-scale randomized controlled trial      (RCT).      Therefore, 16 subjects will be enrolled in this study and their expectations for the      treatment of traditional Chinese medicine combined with stem cells and their experience to      participate in this study will be interviewed.

","      The aim of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of AloCELYVIR, which consist in      bone marrow-derived allogenic mesenchymal stem cells infected with an oncolytic Adenovirus,      ICOVIR-5. It has recently been proven that this type of cells are able of transporting      oncolytic substances to tumor targets that are difficult to reach, such as medulloblastomas      and gliomas, youth cancers located in the cranial cavity that have a poor prognosis and a      fatal outcome. In addition, to exerting an anti-tumor action, this virus has the ability to      stimulate the immune response, making the therapy even more effective. Thus, the diffuse      intrinsic pontine glioma and the medulloblastoma in relapse/progression have been chosen to      study the potential of this new advanced therapy through a weekly infusion for 8 weeks.

","      The incidence of head and neck cancer is increasing in the Western World, including Denmark.      Cancer of the head and neck and its treatment often have a detrimental and lifelong impact on      the quality of life of the patients. Radiotherapy is a key component for approximately 80% of      all patients with head and neck cancer and despite the enormous improvement in ionizing      radiotherapy, the radiation still leads to significant ionizing of healthy tissue, including      the radiation-sensitive salivary glands. Salivary glands suffer severe damage from radiation,      and as these cells are the principal sites of fluid secretion one of the most prevalent side      effect of irradiation for head and neck cancer is hyposalivation and dry mouth syndrome,      xerostomia. Xerostomia leads to debilitating oral disorders and major implication for the      overall quality of life, including social life and professional life. Currently, only      symptomatic treatment is available to patients suffering from xerostomia, and therefore there      is an immense, unmet need for new treatment strategies for hyposalivation and xerostomia.      Stem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of      disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types, and stem cells      have been suggested as an approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after      radiotherapy damage.      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of stem cells      from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in      previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to develop a      clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering from      xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful since      only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom of      xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.    ","      Background:      Xerostomia is the diagnosis of the subjective feeling of dry mouth. Xerostomia can coexist      with or exist without a reduced production of saliva, although xerostomia is first perceived      when unstimulated whole saliva flow rate is reduced by more than 40-50%. In this context, a      subnormal or pathologically reduced saliva production (hyposalivation) will severely diminish      the quality of life and lead to severe dental decay. The two main causes of grave xerostomia      are Sjögren's syndrome and radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. Radiation therapy      plays a central role in the curative treatment of most upper head and neck cancers, either as      a single modality or in combination with chemotherapy and/or surgery, and the prevalence of      xerostomia after head and neck radiation ranges from 74 to 85%.      Radiation therapy increases local tumor control significantly along with the chance of      survival, but despite the more advanced methods of radiation therapy, Intensity-Modulated      radiation therapy (IMRT), a significant proportion of the radiation is deposited in the      healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. The decrease of saliva secretion after radiation      therapy predisposes the patients to a variety of conditions. These are either directly or      indirectly a result of the decreased production of saliva and include xerostomia, impairment      of the normal oral functions (talking, chewing, and swallowing) due to insufficient wetting,      and reduced lubrication of mucosal surfaces and the ingested food which impairs nutrition.      Furthermore, the oral mucosa can become dry, making the oral mucosa vulnerable, which may      lead to frictional trauma and ulceration. In addition, a reduced salivary flow results in a      reduced ""rinsing"" of the entire oral cavity, thus leading to microbial overgrowth, which in      addition to other factors may result in rapid dental decay, dental erosion, and oral      candidiasis (thrush).      Stem cells have been identified as a potential treatment modality for a wide variety of      disorders by their ability to differentiate into many functional cell types. For more than      ten years, researchers have investigated the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an      approach to restoring the function of salivary glands after radiotherapy damage and several      groups have addressed the use of MSCs or adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) in      preclinical studies of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction.      The research group has completed an encouraging randomized-controlled pilot study (MESRIX-I)      with 30 patients assessing the safety and efficacy of ex-vivo expanded autologous ASCs for      radiation-induced xerostomia in an effort to regenerate the function of the salivary glands      (EudraCT nb:2014-004349-29). The results of this study show most importantly that the      treatment is safe without any serious adverse events (SAE) and no systemic reactions, and      secondly, the patients treated with stem cells have a promising enhanced production of saliva      of 33%-50%. Furthermore, the research group has shown that the stem cell group gained vital      quality of life measures compared with the placebo group in the form of diminished trouble in      eating.      The research group has furthermore recently investigated the safety of allogenic ASCs for the      treatment of xerostomia (MESRIX-II) with a clinical safety and feasible trial (EudraCT nb:      2018-003856-19). The study included ten patients who received intraglandular injections of      allogeneic ASCs. No serious treatment-related adverse reaction occurred, and the efficacy      data was similar to the results from our first trial with autologous ASCs.      Research hypothesis Treatment with ASCs will result in an improvement of the participant's      unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva flow rate and ameliorate the xerostomia and increase      quality of life.      Study aim The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the injection of      allogeneic ASCs from healthy donors on radiation-induced salivary gland hypofunction and      xerostomia in previous head and neck cancer patients. The project can potentially help to      develop a clinically relevant treatment option for the growing number of patients suffering      from xerostomia after irradiation. The development of new therapies is especially meaningful      since only sub-optimal, symptomatic treatments are currently available, and since the symptom      of xerostomia immensely reduces quality of life.      Study design The study is an investigator-initiated, prospective, single-center,      double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to compare the safety, tolerability and      efficacy of ASCs as a treatment for radiation-induced hyposalivation and xerostomia for      previous head and neck cancer patients.      Method Patients between the age of 18-70 years previously treated with radiation for a head      and neck cancer and a clinically evaluated reduced salivation and hyposalivation, evaluated      by a screening, can be included. Each participant will be double-blindly randomized to      receive either allogeneic ASCs or placebo consisting of CryoStor10 (BiolifeSolutions), the      freeze media for ASCs containing 10% Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Allogeneic ASCs are provided      from the Cardiology Stem Cell Centre (CSCC) at Rigshospitalet.      Patients will be evaluated on salivary gland function and saliva flow rate by sialometry.      Both unstimulated whole saliva and stimulated whole saliva will be collected. Furthermore,      the investigators will analyze the following on the collected saliva: pH and bicarbonate by      ionic balance estimation, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, chloride and fluoride, total      protein and selected proteins, and amylase. For evaluation of the participants´ perception of      xerostomia, the participants will answer validated questionnaires in Danish (EORTC QLQ Module      for H&N-35 and XQ) at baseline and after four months. These patient-reported outcomes (PRO)      questionnaires are essential, validated tools for estimating the degree of quality of life      (QoL) and xerostomia.      Recruitment of MESRIX-III participants and obtaining informed consent MESRIX-III participants      (recipients/placebo) will be recruited through the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and      Neck Surgery at Rigshospitalet and Oncology Departments at Rigshospitalet and Herlev      Hospital, and through our databases on head and neck cancer patients. The investigator will      send a letter to eligible patients who have been treated and followed for their previous      cancer disease. Eligible patients can also contact the investigators or a trained member of      the MESRIX-III study by phone or by a specific study e-mail      (regionh-stamcelle.rigshospitalet@regionh.dk) if the eligible patients wish to receive a      letter with further information. Subsequently, the principal investigator or a trained member      of the MESRIX-III study group will contact patients by phone and inquire about their interest      in participating in the research project.      If the eligible patients have an interest in participating in the project, the eligible      patients will be invited to an interview at the outpatient clinic of the Department of      Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Rigshospitalet for further information concerning the      trial. In the written information material, besides material about the trial, the pamphlets      ""Rights of test subjects in a health scientific research project"" and ""before decision"" will      be included. The right to bring counsel to the information interview will likewise be      explained. Motivated patients referred from doctors in other parts of Denmark and patients      who approach our department with an interest in participation in the stem cell research will      also be offered information about the trial. Patients from all parts of Denmark can be      included if the participants pass the inclusion and exclusion criteria described below.      However, transportation and accommodation cannot be provided.      The information interview will take place in an undisturbed environment with the principal      investigator or trained member of the MESRIX-III study group, who has the professional      qualifications to communicate the content of the research project, and who will clearly      explain that it is a request to participate in a health science research project. The      participant will be given oral information about the project in layman's terms on the basis      of the written information, and any questions will be answered. The oral information will be      adapted to the participant's requirements, and it will be explained without the use of      technical terms. Participants will be informed of the right to reflection following the      information interview. Participants will likewise be informed of the opportunity to get      feedback on the scientific results but will also be informed that no new information on the      individual participant's disease or prognosis will be obtained. The potential participants      for MESRIX-III will be contacted by telephone by the responsible physician for final      commitment to participate. If participants are still interested in participating in the      project, an appointment is made where a medical history is taken, and where the remaining      trial appointments will be planned in agreement with the participant, and here the      participants and the responsible physician will sign the medical consent form.      Evaluation, reporting, and recording of adverse events All adverse events (AEs) are monitored      and recorded along with concomitant medicine at the scheduled follow-up (day one, and 4      months after the intervention). AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence in the      clinical trial participant administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily      have a causal relationship with the treatment (ASC/placebo). AEs will be assessed and graded      according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0 guidelines (CTCAEv5.0).      Thus, all adverse events are recorded with CTCAE grade. All grade 3 and grade 4 events and      incidents considered related to this trial will be reported to the sponsor by the      investigator immediately after the events are discovered.      An adverse reaction (AR) is defined as any untoward or unintended response in a participant      to an investigational medical product (IMP) which is related to any dose administered to that      subject.      An adverse Drug Reaction (ADR) is stated as all noxious and unintended responses to a      medicinal product related to any dose should be considered ADR.      Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious Adverse Reaction (SAR), or Suspected Unexpected Serious      Adverse Reaction (SUSAR), means any AE, AE, SUSAR, respectively, that:        1. Results in death or        2. A serious deterioration in health that             1. Resulted in life-threatening illness or injury             2. Required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization             3. Resulted in permanent impairment of body structure or body function             4. Resulted in medical or surgical treatment to prevent the above        3. Lead to foetal death, congenital anomaly or birth defect, or other negative effect on           the foetus        4. Anything the Principal Investigator deems to be of Clinical serious significance      Medical judgment will be exercised by the primary investigator together with the sponsor      whether an AE or AR should be classified as serious in other situations.      The included participants will be instructed to contact the principal investigator or a      special trained person from the research group in case of events with possible relation to      the trial treatment within the main study period.      The principal investigator will immediately (within maximum 24 hours after receiving the      information) inform the sponsor if SAR, SAE or serious suspected adverse reactions occurs.      The sponsor will report SUSAR (Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction) to the Danish      Medicines Agency and the Danish National Committee on Health Research Ethics within 15 days      of occurrence and 7 days in case of death or life-threatening issue. Unexpected reactions are      defined as reactions that are not described in the section ""Reference Safety information"" of      this protocol. All other unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported within 15 days      after the sponsor becomes aware of these.      All SARs that have occurred during the trial will be reported to The Danish Medicines Agency,      The Danish Patient Safety Authority, and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics (if      appropriate) once a year by the sponsor.      The sponsor will annually send a concise review and evaluation of pertinent safety      information, a Development Safety update report (DSUR) collected during the reporting period      related to the Danish Medicines Agency (DKMA).      After completion of the trial, the sponsor will after 90 days inform the Danish Medicines      Agency that the study is completed. Within a year, the sponsor will submit trial results to      the board, according to the law on drugs (Lov om lægemidler) § 89. 2, No. 4      Reference safety information (RSI) Adverse events with possible relation to injection of      ASCs: Type; Frequency; Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not      serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious Temporary swelling of      the salivary gland; 10-50%; Not serious      Adverse events with relation to similar procedures and in MESRIX-I: Type; Frequency;      Seriousness Temporary soreness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;      Not serious Temporary redness of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;      Not serious Temporary swelling of the salivary gland (up to 7 days after injection); 10-20%;      Not serious Infection of the salivary gland; 0.5-5%; Not serious Bleeding/hematoma in the      salivary gland; 1-5%; Not serious      The above numbers and AEs are based on the previous phase I-II trial (EudraCT:      2014-004349-29) and on the literature cited and described in the section ""Risk Assessment"".      In the previous study by the research group, MESRIX-I, with autologous ASCs no SAR or SUSARs      were detected, so any SAR in this study will be reported as a SUSAR.      Long-term safety and efficacy follow-up Following Committee for Medicinal Products for Human      Use (CHMP) under EMEA draft from January 2018 on safety and efficacy (S&E) follow-up and risk      management of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP), the MESRIX-III participants will be      invited to a follow-up of efficacy and ARs one year after the intervention (ASCs/placebo).      Longer follow-up is not needed based on the reported long-term safety described in the      section.      ""Risk Assessment"". Follow-up will include basic ear, nose, and throat examination,      fiberscope, ultrasound of submandibular glands, sialometry, and blood samples. Data from the      electronic medical journals and national pathology database will be gathered. It is expected      that a number of the participants will have a recurrence of their primary cancer during the      study or follow-up period due to the nature of the head and neck cancer. The allogeneic MSCs      are believed to be rejected in the recipients, and the stem cells are adult non-pluripotent.      However, in case of recurrence of cancer or new primary cancer developments each case will be      carefully evaluated and potentially investigated with genetic analysis in an attempt to      distinguish whether a tumor is due to recurrence, the administered product, or endogenous      tumor formation.      Sample size and power considerations From MESRIX-I it appeared to be realistic to increase      saliva production for whole unstimulated salivary flow (in milliliter(ml)/minut) rate by      about 33% or in absolute numbers from 0.125 to 0.151 after 1 month and 0.155 after 4 months.      The power calculation is based on a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. This means that the      total number of patients included would have to be 100 (50 in each group) for a paired      t-test. 10-20 additional participants may be included to compensate for dropout during the      study period. The investigators believe that a 33% increase in whole, unstimulated salivary      flow rate is clinically important and also realistic to detect.      Ethical considerations The trial is conducted in accordance with the Helsinki II declaration.      The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency (DPA)      will be requested permission to conduct the study. Moreover, the Danish Medicines Agency will      be requested approval, and the trial will be monitored by the Good Clinical Practice (GCP)      unit (Birgitte Grøn). Each volunteer (MESRIX-III participants) is required to give written      informed consent before he/she can be included in the study. Information obtained about      participants' health, other purely private matters, and other confidential information is      covered by professional secrecy. No project participant has a personal financial incentive to      implement the described project. The samples will be analyzed and stored in Denmark.      Risk assessment When the study participants in MESRIX-III will receive either ASCs or placebo      into the large salivary glands the risk of adverse events such as infection and bleeding is      estimated to be below 0.5% when using similar procedures. In our previous studies, none of      the 40 participants developed adverse reactions.      The MESRIX-III participants may also experience some pain briefly during injection of the      transplant product (ASCs or placebo).      A theoretical risk of a possible carcinogenic effect in the treatment of MSC/ASCs has been      discussed. This is due to their production of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor      (EGF), a factor produced by the MSC/ASCs. These considerations are particularly relevant      since ASCs are used in participants previously diagnosed with cancer. However, in model      systems of cancer, the effect of MSCs on cancer growth is controversial as MSCs have both      been shown to be inhibitory and stimulatory. Further, numerous clinical trials with more than      1000 participants have been conducted with MSCs in different participant populations, and no      increase in the incidence of cancer has been detected. These studies include local injection      of MSCs. With respect to the use of ex vivo expanded MSCs, despite extensive research, there      is no data indicating malignant transformation of expanded human MSCs/ASCs.      Data collection Source data: There will be source documentation for all data in Case Report      Form (CRF).      The study director allows direct access to study data and study documents for the monitoring,      audit, and inspection of the Science Ethics Committee, the Danish Health and Medicines      Authority, or similar authorities in other countries. Permission will be sought from the DPA      for the processing of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation.      Applications will be sent via the legal secretariat, Rigshospitalet.      Data will be analyzed with R. Our data will be kept securely in the electronic data capture      system (EDC) Redcap. All data will be directly entered. The trial will be completed when all      data is collected.      All results will be stored and analyzed electronically; participants' anonymity is ensured in      accordance with the national data legislation. After completion of the study, data will be      stored in an anonymous form. Data containing social security numbers will be kept locked and      inaccessible to unauthorized persons.      Subject confidentially The investigator is obliged to ensure that participant anonymity is      protected and maintained. On the CRF´s subjects should be identified by their initials and a      subject study number only, Documents that are not for submission (e.g., signed informed      consent forms) will be kept in strict confidence by the principal investigator. In compliance      with the GCP Guidelines, it is required that the investigator and the institution permit      authorized representatives of a monitoring company direct access to reviewing subjects'      original medical records for verification of study-related procedures and data. All      information obtained concerning this protocol regarding participants is protected according      to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).    ",,"

",      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of using Ossium      vertebral Bone Marrow Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (vBM-MSC) to treat people with an ileal      pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) who develop a fistula in the setting of Crohn's disease of the      pouch.    ,"      Proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) remains the procedure of choice for      patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). IPAA allows at risk tissue to be removed with      restoration of intestinal continuity while maintaining favorable long-term functional      outcomes and quality of life.1 2 While less than 30% of patients experience short-term      postoperative morbidity following IPAA,3-5 up to 15% of pouches will ultimately fail due to      technical or inflammatory complications, the majority of which manifest as a fistula from the      pouch to the perianal or vaginal locations.1,2,6-8 Pouch failure due to a fistula tract is      notoriously difficult to treat. Despite immunosuppressive medications and attempts at local      repair, most patients will end up with a pouch excision and permanent ostomy. This can be a      devastating outcome in some patients as it impacts body image and quality of life.1      Given the high safety profile, and relative success in treating perianal disease, we sought      to use a GMP grade allogeneic bone marrow derived MSCs to establish safety and secondarily      monitor for healing in patients with ileal anal anastomosis and ileal pouch fistulas. This      trial will use allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to produce      regenerative signals.      This study will enroll adult men and women who have undergone IPAA at least six months prior      and now have a peri-pouch fistula related to Crohn's disease of the pouch. Subjects who are      refractory to conventional medical therapy will be considered. Subjects enrolled will be      those that meet current indications.    ",,"

The TP-IAT procedure will remain as routinely performed. Patients will be      followed for12 months post-transplantation, having 3 follow-up visits scheduled on days 90,      180, and 365 after the transplant. The primary endpoint will be a change in islet function      from baseline to 12 months post-transplantation as measured by the C-peptide area under the      curve following a mixed meal tolerance test. Potential effects of MSCs on glycemic control,      pain relief, quality of life, and adverse events will be evaluated at each follow-up visit.    ",,"

","      DREAM is a phase II B efficacy monocentric, prospective, randomized, controlled double      blinded trial, comparing intra-discal autologous adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells      (BM-MSC) therapy and sham treated controls in subjects with chronic (> 6 months) Low Back      Pain (LBP) due to lumbar multilevel (max. 3 levels) intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD)      unresponsive to conventional therapy.      Duration of the recruitment period has been estimated to be 12 months. The efficacy of      intradiscal injection of autologous BM-MSC in reducing chronic LBP due to multilevel lumbar      IDD will be evaluated after 24 months in terms of pain relief (VAS), functionality (ODI) and      quality of life (SF36).    ","      Low back pain (LBP) is the global leading cause of disability, and furthermore rates sixth in      terms of overall disease burden, in both developed and developing countries. LPB is a      condition of all ages, from children to elderly, affecting 60-70 percent of the global      population during life, and ~700 million people each year. LBP prevalence increases with age,      and with populations ageing worldwide, the societal and economic burden associated with LBP      will increase substantially over coming years.      Current LBP therapies are aimed at pain reduction, and do not provide restorative treatment.      Such conservative strategies (e.g. painkillers and musculoskeletal rearrangement by manual      and physiotherapy) rarely address the actual cause of LBP.      In a healthy spine, intervertebral discs (IVDs) separate the vertebrae to provide complex      spinal flexibility while supporting large spinal loads. Intervertebral disc degeneration      (IDD) is widely recognized as a major contributor to LBP, responsible for at least 40 percent      of LBP cases. A key characteristic of IVD degeneration is loss of matrix integrity, thereby      causing biomechanical functional failure.      Today, no therapy can restore IVD function or provide long-term relief from symptomatic IDD.      New treatment strategies concentrate on treating IDD at an early stage. Stem cell research      offers exciting possibilities, and advanced cell-based therapies are considered highly      promising strategies in treating IVD degeneration and LBP. Encouraging results suggest that      cell-based, regenerative therapies may provide the world first effective therapy for this      common and debilitating disease.      The objective of DREAM is to generate efficacy and tolerability profiles of a single      injection of 15 million of cells/ml of autologous BM-MSC for each disc affected by IDD (up to      3 discs) versus sham procedure. The potential of BM-MSC to lead to a disease-modifying      therapeutic option for the treatment of this chronic and debilitating disease will be      assessed by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) after 6 months, 1 and 2 years.

Randomized
Parallel Assignment
Patients will be randomized in 2 arms of 26 patients and followed up for 24 months.
Treatment
Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)
The randomization will be centralized and stratified on the investigation center. Treatment allocation will be performed 24 hour-a-day online by a central randomization web-service. The patient identification must be unique within all randomizations performed. For double-blind trial the randomization result will be a treatment code. Blinding or masking will be carried out at all stages of packaging and conditioning for shipping following the treatment allocation. Injections used for all groups will be clear and indistinguishable from each other.
","Pain ChangeFrom Baseline to Month 24Changes in pain will be evaluated on Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) between baseline and month 24. VAS scale ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable., Functional disability index evaluationFrom Baseline to Month 24Functional disability changes will be assessed on Oswestry Disability Index (ODI, also known as the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire) at month 24 compared with baseline. ODI scale ranges from 0 to 50 and allows evaluation of disability (0 - 20 percent: minimal disability; 20 - 40 percent: moderate disability; 40 - 60 percent: severe disability; 60 - 80 percent: crippled; 80 - 100 percent: bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms).","
Disability evolution
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Disability evolution includes Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) scores. SF-36 scores consist of eight 0-100 scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning and mental health) where a lower score corresponds to more disability and a higher score corresponds to less disability.
,
Quality of life evolution
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Quality of life evolution includes global assessment by the patient and the physician.
The global assessment by the patient and the physician involves evaluation of: - Overall pain intensity in the lumbar spine (1 = none, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe, 5 = extreme); - patient's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor); - physician's global assessment of disease activity (1 = very good, 2 = good, 3 = fair, 4 = poor, 5 = very poor).
,
Drug consumption of rescue painkillers medication
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
The decrease/increase in the use of rescue medication will be recorded throughout the study duration by a diary file. A reduction in dose or frequency of administration of painkillers is an indirect marker of the benefits of MSC therapy.
,
Measurement of pain
Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months
Assessed by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS). VAS pain scale ranges from 0 to 100: where 0 represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable. In brief, the patients will fill VAS tests indicating the amount of pain experienced at rest and in motion.
,
Employment and work status assessment
Baseline and 24 months
For this the investigators will assign each of the patients to one of 4 categories designated as ""employable"" which included those who were unemployed due to pain, employed but on sick leave, laid off, or working. The other categories include retired, disabled, and elderly at least 60 years of age, eligible for social security.
,
Structural assessment
Baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months
Evolution of affected disc(s) by quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) density measurements in T2 and T1 spin/echo and T1 rho weighted images used as an indication of disc fluid and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) content. The ""quality"" of the patient's lumbar disc/discs will be monitored non invasively using T2 weighted MRI sagittal images and, in T1 spin/echo MRI. Lumbar disc grading will be performed in the sagittal T2 weighted images by two physicians independently who were experienced in MRI of the spine. They will review each intervertebral disc from L1-2 to L5-S1 by the modified Pfirrmann criteria. The modified Pfirrmann grading system assesses degenerated intervertebral discs by MRI for the asymmetry in disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and the annulus, signal intensity of intervertebral discs and height of intervertebral discs and assigns grade 1 to 8 for disc degeneration.
,
Evaluation of costs
12 and 24 months
The investigators will compare the medical and non-medical costs between the two groups of patient. For this purpose, resource use in each arm will be collected in physical units in the eCRF (electronic case report form) at the clinical centre as follows:
Acute care medical hospitalisations related to IDD
Acute care surgical hospitalisations related to IDD
Rehabilitation hospitalisations related to IDD

","      The aim of the study is to compare the clinical effects of treatment of knee osteoarthritis      using adipose tissue mesenchymal stromal cells obtained by an enzymatic method with the      outcomes of the therapy with the mechanically fragmented adipose tissue. Identification and      functional analysis of the regenerative capacity of MSCs derived from the adipose tissue      depending on three variables (body weight, sex and age) will help to develop a targeted      therapy for different groups of patients and will determine the effectiveness of both methods      of treatment. An attempt was made to identify the groups of patients with the greatest      regeneration potential of the adipose tissue, and thus indicate those with the most probable      improvement of the joint condition.    ","      Based on the calculation of the sample size using power analysis of the test, investigators      plan to include 100 adults with primary knee osteoarthritis in this study. The patients will      undergo lipoaspiration under sterile conditions of the operating theatre, the collected      lipoaspirates will be further processed - enzymatically with the use of collagenase or      mechanically using the Lipogems system. After collection, lipoaspirates will be immediately      transferred to the laboratory of the Department of Regenerative Medicine with a tissue and      cells bank in Warsaw, and the preparations will be administered to the patients' knee joints      in the operating room under ultrasound control.      The Lipogems system is defined as a minimal tissue manipulation system. In contrast, the      administration of preparations produced using an enzymatic method requires advanced actions.      Lipoaspiration will be performed using blind cannulas and vacuum syringes introduced through      the abdominal wall with a three-millimetre incision on the skin after previous injection to      the adipose tissue with modified Klein's solution (500 ml of saline solution, 1 ml of      adrenaline, 40 ml of 2% lignocaine), which makes the collection easier. 10 ml of the      collected adipose tissue will be used to examine the samples after previous gradient drainage      from Klein's solution. Immediately after collection, the samples will be sent to the      laboratory for analysis (cell count testing, culture, phenotype identification, analysis by      flow cytometry).      The patients will be monitored in the hospital outpatient clinic for one year after the      procedure; the control visits will take place: after 2 and 6 weeks, then after 3 and 6 months      and after a year. A physical examination and the assessment using the KOOS questionnaire will      be performed. Before the procedure and after one year, an X-ray and MRI with T-2 Mapping will      be carried out in order to evaluate the condition of the cartilage.    ",,"

A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No problems) to 4 (Extreme problems) and each of the five scores is calculated as the sum of the items included.Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic scales and generic measures.

","To investigate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by improvements in the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL) 54 Instrument.Baseline to Week 52The MSQOL-54 is a comprehensive health-related quality of life measure incorporating general and MS-specific questions into a single instrument.The developers used the SF-36 as a base and added 18 questions to address MS-specific problems, including fatigue and cognitive function.This 54-item questionnaire provides 12 sub-scales, two summary scores, and two extra single-item measures. The sub-scales are physical function, role limits-physical, emotional role restrictions, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social position, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. There is no single overall score for MSQOL-54. Two summary scores - physical health and mental health - can be derived from a weighted combination of scale scores (scale scores range from 0 to 100 and a higher scale score indicates improved quality of life).","
To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by changes in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
Baseline to Week 52
The EDSS is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. This scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5-unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist.

To evaluate the efficacy of intravenous infusions of HB-adMSCs vs placebo in patients with Multiple Sclerosis as determined by changes in the Barthel Index
Baseline to Week 52
The Barthel index is an ordinal scale that evaluates functional independence in the domains of personal care and mobility. A total of ten variables describing activities of daily living and mobility are considered, with a higher number reflecting better capacity to operate independently. The Barthel Index assesses the level of help needed by a person on a set of ten activities of daily living (ADL) related to mobility and self-care.

","      This is a Phase 1 Clinical Safety Study intended to provide preliminary assessments of the      safety, tolerability, and clinical alleviation of symptoms associated with Post Concussion      Syndrome (PCS), also known as Chronic Concussive Syndrome (CCS).    ","      The proposed study is a single-site, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving a      single administration of either individual, autologous ATCell™ lines suspended in 5% dextrose      lactated Ringer's solution or a vehicle (5% dextrose Lactated Ringer's solution) not      containing cells. Each ATCell™ cell line will be created from cells grown from the stromal      vascular fraction (SVF) of a participant's own adipose tissue collected by liposuction, and      each treated participant will only receive their own cells.      Within the treated group, 3 dosing levels will be explored: 50 million cells, 150 million      cells, or 300 million cells, and a Placebo group which will receive 5% dextrose lactated      Ringer's solution free of cells. Participant follow-ups will take place 1 day following the      tissue harvest procedure and, 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following      ATCell™ treatment. Comprehensive participant's evaluations involving data collection will      take place 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment.      It has been proposed that in general, mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) events need to be      taken far more seriously, and that even mild TBI events can result in lasting negative      consequences as evidenced by lower performances on neuropsychological assessments when      compared with age-matched controls2. In fact, this condition may eventually lead to      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as well as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), which, together      may be termed the AD-like dementias3, further underscoring the need for effective clinical      intervention. Currently, no effective treatments are available for this condition aside from      treatment of the symptoms, although some more comprehensive treatments have been proposed.    ",,"

","      Knee joint cartilage cells metabolize slowly, and it is difficult to repair themselves after      injury. Any knee joint trauma or the progression of osteoarthritis may lead to the      progression of cartilage or osteochondral defects. Compared with bone marrow mesenchymal stem      cells (MSCs), peripheral blood MSCs have better chondrogenic differentiation ability. At the      same time, the mobilization of peripheral blood MSCs and the advancement of extraction      technology also make it feasible to treat osteochondral damage by using peripheral blood      MSCs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of surgical      transplantation of autologous peripheral blood MSCs to repair knee joint Ⅳ-degree localized      cartilage injury, and to explore a new treatment for osteochondral defects based on the      foundation of the research group's previous research.

In order to compare the difference between groups in the amount of change in each evaluation variable at the time of visit after cell administration/best supportive therapy compared to the baseline value, covariance analysis (ANCOVA) is performed by setting the baseline time point and stratification factor as a correction variable for each evaluation variable.
CP score was calculated using five factors: hepatic encephalopathy, prothrombin time, bilirubin, serum albumin, and ascites, and the score range was 5-15 points.
In the Child-Pugh grade, scores of the five factors are summed and evaluated as A if it is less than 7 points, B if it is 7-9, and C if it exceeds 9 points.

","      The aim of this study is to determine the contribution of genetic factors to the pathogenesis      of diseases, including diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Hirschsprung's disease, and      autism. Patient-derived cellular models of diseases will be developed, which will require the      collection of blood samples from patients and healthy individuals in order to generate      induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for the development of iPSC-derived human cell      cultures. These human cellular models will be phenotyped using a variety of methods,      including cellular, molecular, and biochemical assays. Because these human cellular models      will retain the genetic background from the patients and control subjects, this will allow us      to determine the contribution of genetics to disease phenotypes. Such disease-specific      pluripotent stem cell lines will be invaluable tools for many basic and translational      research applications, including pathophysiological studies in a developmental context, and      innovation and screening of small molecule drugs capable of reversing the disease phenotype      and potentially leading to a cure for a broad range of diseases, where appropriate in vitro      or in vivo disease models do not exist.

","      ***At this time, we are only enrolling at Houston Methodist Hospital (HMH)/Baylor College of      Medicine (BCM) and are not shipping cells outside of BCM/HMH.***      This is a study for patients who have respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 that have      not gotten better. Because there is no standard treatment for this infection, patients are      being asked to volunteer for a gene transfer research study using mesenchymal stem cells      (MSCs).      Stem cells are cells that do not yet have a specific function in the body. Mesenchymal stem      cells (MSCs) are a type of stem cell that can be grown from bone marrow (the spongy tissue      inside of bones). Stem cells can develop into other types of more mature (specific) cells,      such as blood and muscle cells.      The purpose of this study is to see if MSCs versus controls can help to treat respiratory      infections caused by SARS-CoV-2.    ","      Earlier, a healthy donor provided blood cells to generate MSCs. These cells were grown and      frozen for later use.      Before being treated, the patient will receive a series of standard medical tests: These      tests are done to assess the patient's eligibility to receive the cells.        -  Physical exam and history        -  SARS-CoV-2 test        -  Blood tests        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan        -  A urine pregnancy test, when applicable      The patient will be randomly assigned to a study group. We'll use a computer to put the      patient into study group A (study drug) or group B (control) by chance (randomized). Patients      randomized to the control group, will receive the standard treatment for their respiratory      infection.      On the day that the patient is scheduled to receive the cells they will be pre-medicated with      Benadryl and Tylenol. The patient will then receive an intravenous (into the vein) infusion      of 1 x 10^8 cells/kg of MSCs. The patient will be monitored closely for two hours after the      infusion. The patient will receive a second infusion at the same dose within 3-5 days of the      initial infusion (at the discretion of the investigator) if there is no improvement in      respiratory parameters or if there is a worsening of Acute respiratory distress syndrome      (ARDS).      The patient will receive standard medical tests when getting the infusion(s) and afterwards.      As part of the research study, the patient will be evaluated daily for 7 days and then weekly      at weeks 2, 3, and 4. The evaluations that will be done at these visits include:        -  Physical exam and history        -  SARS-CoV-2 test        -  Blood tests        -  Chest X-ray or chest CT Scan    ",,"

","      Patients receiving radiation therapy are still at risk for side effects due to off-target      radiation damage of normal tissues The number of cancer patients is expected to increase from      14.1 million around the world in 2012 to 19.3 million in 2025. Up to ten percent will develop      late severe gastrointestinal complications (i.e. Pelvic Radiation Disease - PRD). Symptoms      are proctopathy (5-20%) and radiation-induced cystitis (3,5%) that affect quality of life.      The treatment of PRD is limited to managing the symptoms; new alternatives should be      proposed.      Clinical trials using MSCs to treat hemorrhagic cystitis, proctopathy have demonstrated the      feasibility to used MSCs in these pathologies :        -  MSCs successfully repair hemorrhagic cystitis, and perforated colon in patients with           hemorrhagic cystitis, perforated colon and peritonitis.        -  Six clinical trials are currently ongoing for proctopathy, 3 are phase III. Results           suggest an inhibition of chronic inflammation and fistulization and interruption of           hemorrhagic syndromes.        -  Clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of MSCs to treat hemorrhagic cystitis is in           progress.        -  A decrease in pain after the injection of MSCs was observed in patients treated by           radiotherapy for breast cancer, radiation burns, and radiotherapy over-dosage.        -  Four patients, were treated with MSCs after receiving overdose pelvic irradiation for           prostate cancer. A decrease in pain (EN score), bleeding and diarrhea was observed.      MSCs will represent a promising alternative strategy in the treatment of severe enteritis,      rectitis and cystitis after radiotherapy, and may avoid surgical treatment and may diminish      the adverse effect of PRD in terms of chronicity, morbidity, mortality and health costs.    ","      -Chemo-radiation enhances survival but also increases the risk of PRD. The result will be an      increasing        -  Cost for society (repeated hospitalization for palliative care)        -  An ethical problem to help these patients with irreversible degraded quality of life.      Results from conventional therapies for PRD reveal a poor long-term efficacy:      i. Coagulation by plasma argon is insufficient, 58% at 6 months; ii. The efficacy of formalin      is questionable (48%), as is 5-amino-salicylate, sulfasalazine, vitamin E and pentoxifylline      ; iii. The efficacy of short chain fatty acids and hyperbaric oxygen therapy is low (40%);      iv. Steroids are of limited efficacy (37%). v. A surgical operation in an irradiated field is      associated with difficult or impossible healing as well as with risks of infection (mortality      of 5% within 40 months) Furthermore, conventional therapies are palliative and badly      tolerated. More effective approaches are thus crucial.        -  PRD unfortunately remains a major side effect of radiotherapy and there is no           established effective treatment. Consequently, the recruitment of the aforementioned           number of patients by participating radiotherapy centers is ensured.        -  MSC therapy is a safe and suitable option in severe PRD.             -  The investigators propose a proof of concept.             -  MSC production and injection protocol has already been successfully employed in                compassionate therapy on four patients, who suffered from chronic and fistulizing                colitis, after radiotherapy for prostate cancer.        -  PRISME is a network project which includes St Antoine Hospital, INSERM (National           Institute of Health and Medical Research), EFS (French Blood Establishment ), CTSA (Army           Centre of Blood Transfusion) ECellFrance, IRSN (Institute for Radiological Protection           and Nuclear Safety), IGR (Gustave Roussy Institute), and Institute of cancerology of           west France. Our consortium has robust experience of the treatment of radiation damages,           preclinical models and the medical management of PRD using biotherapy. Clinical and           scientific achievements, previous collaborations of the different groups and preliminary           partner's data assure the fulfillment of the program.             -  Patient selection will be performed by the six radiotherapy centers participating                in this study. The expected recruitment per center had been concluded from the                average number of potentially eligible patients treated and surveyed in each of the                following centers (St Antoine Hospital, Gustave Roussy Institute, Institute of                cancerology of west France).             -  The ECellFrance platform will ensure MSC production. This platform includes two                locations in Parisian region: EFS (in the city of Creteil) and CTSA.             -  Support, trials and intervention protocols will be handled in the Department of                Clinical Hematology at St Antoine Hospital, renowned for its expertise in the                treatment of overdosed radiation therapy patients, i.e. Epinal cases) and which has                managed a PHRC using MSCs.             -  Participation of a research group with robust experience in stem cells,                transplantation (Research centre Saint Antoine, INSERM) and radiobiology, cell                therapy treatment of radiation accidents (IRSN, CTSA). These groups will carry out                the characterization of the biological activity and immunological properties of the                native MSC bone marrow tissue in vitro (INSERM) and in vivo (IRSN) and                immunological monitoring of patients treated with the MSC (INSERM).      It is expected to achieve the healing of chronic refractory diseases, leading to lower health      expenses by reducing patient treatment and hospitalization, and to an increase in their      quality of life by a:        -  Decrease in rectorrhagia and hematuria, pain, drug-consumption;        -  Inhibition of hemorrhagic syndromes and chronic inflammation accompanied by a sustained           fistulization arrest due to the repairing capability of MSC.      The expected results for the public will be the healing of chronic refractory diseases,      leading to lower health expenses by reducing patient treatment and hospitalization, and to an      increase in their quality of life.      Hypothesis: MSC injections provide an efficient alternative approach in the treatment of PRD      for patient refractories to conventional treatments.      Patient study scheduled:      D-60: Screening by 6 radiotherapy centers. D-1: Inclusion in Saint Antoine Hospital. D0, D7      and D14: IV MSC injection (2x106 - 6x106/kg MSC). M2 and M4: follow-up visit. End of      patient's participation to the study at M4. Total number of scheduled patients: 12 patients      suffering from PRD. Simon minimax plan, P0=25%, P1=60%, Alpha=5% and Beta=20%.      Stopping rules:      Step 1: (n1=5) inclusion of 5 patients r1=1: if the number of success is <2, the study will      end for MSC inefficacy. If the number of success is ≥2, proceed to step 2. Step 2: (n2=7)      inclusion of up to 7 patients r2=5: as soon as the number of successes reaches 6 (>r2),      inclusions will be discontinued and MSC will be considered as sufficiently promising for      further studies.

",      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Expanded Umbilical Cord      Mesenchymal Stem Cells on patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Any adverse events      related to UCMSCs infusion will be monitored.The primary outcome is the improvement rate of      PASI(Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) and treatment response will be computed from PASI      before and after UCMSCs infusion.    ,"      Psoriasis is an immune-mediated, genetic disease manifesting in the skin or joints or both.      Numerous topical and systemic therapies are available for the treatment of psoriasis.      Treatment modalities are chosen on the basis of disease severity, relevant comorbidities,      patient preference. For moderate to severe psoriasis, phototherapy, systemic therapy and      biologic immune modifying agents are recommended, but all of them have some drawbacks or      limitations. Until now, no curative treatment is available. Therefore, it is important to      find new treatment for psoriasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of adult stem      cells that can differentiate into bone, cartilage and adipose cells. Umbilical cord      Mesenchymal Stem Cells were isolated from umbilical cord matrix and were reported to treat      moderate to severe psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis arthritis successfully by case reports.      For the mechanism of the disease, involvement of the immune system in psoriasis is now widely      accepted. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are found to have the function of immunomodulation,      migration to skin lesions, limitation of autoimmunity. Therefore, investigators supposed that      the injection of UCMSCs could be beneficial for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.    ",,"

",      This trial is to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic      administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty      treatment in Vietnam    ,"      Frailty, a specific condition of increased vulnerability and reduced general health      associated with aging in elderly people, is an emerging global burden requiring major      implications for clinical practice and public health. The lack of standardized definition and      treatment of the disease resulted in the increasing number of elders diagnosed with frailty.      Recently, preclinical and clinical studies support the safety of mesenchymal stem/stromal      cells (MSCs) in the treatment of frailty. However, no comprehensive study has been conducted      to access the interrelationship between frailty conditions and the effects of MSC-based      therapy. To fill this knowledge gap, the aim of the trial is to investigate the safety and      potential therapeutic efficacy of allogeneic administration of umbilical cord-derived MSCs      (UC-MSCs) in combination with standard frailty treatment in Vietnam. Moreover, this study      describes the rationale, study design, methodologies, and analysis strategy currently      employed in stem cell research and clinical study. This randomized case-control phase I/II      trial is conducted at Vinmec Times City International Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam between July      2021 and November 2022. In this trial, 44 patients will be enrolled and randomized into a      UC-MSC administration group and control group. Both groups will receive the standard frailty      treatment and supplementary medication. The UC-MSC group will receive two doses of thawed      UC-MSC product at 1.5x10^6 cells/kg of patient body's weight with an intervention interval of      three months. The primary outcome measures will include the incidence of prespecified      administration-associated adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The      potential efficacy will be evaluated based on the improvement in frailty conditions      (including physical examination, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, immune markers      of frailty, metabolism analysis, and cytokine markers from patient's plasma). The clinical      evaluation will be conducted at baseline and 1-, 3-, 6- and 9-months post-intervention. This      clinical trial and stem cell analysis associated with patients' sampling at different      timepoints seeks to identify and characterize the potential effects of UC-MSCs on the      improvement of frailty based on stem cell quality, cytokines/growth factors secretion      profiles of UC-MSCs, cellular senescence, and metabolic analysis of patient's CD3+ cells. The      ultimate results of the study will be essential for evaluating the utility of UC-MSC therapy      for the treatment of frailty and mechanism underlying these effects providing the fundamental      knowledge for designing and implementing research strategy of future studies    ",,"

","      This study is a two strata, dose escalation Phase I clinical trial designed to assess the      safety and determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of allogenic cord tissue derived MSCs      (cMSCs, stratum 1) and allogeneic, interferon-γ primed bone marrow MSCs (γMSCs, stratum 2).      Each stratum is designed to independently accrue 3 children at a dose level 1 of 2x106      cells/kg and 6 children at dose level 2 of 10x106 cells/kg, resulting in 9 children in each      stratum. The primary objectives are to determine the safety and toxicity of allogeneic cord      tissue derived MSCs and allogeneic interferon-γ primed bone marrow derived MSCs.    ","      Asthma affects one out of every 10 patients in the United States. Many of these patients have      poor asthma symptom control. For example, patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma      have ongoing symptoms and airway inflammation despite aggressive treatment with asthma      medications. These patients are at increased risk for medication-related side effects and      potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Novel therapies are critically needed for this      population.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are cells that reside in the bone marrow. MSCs are      anti-inflammatory and also promote body tissue repair. This study will determine whether one      form of MSCs called ""interferon gamma-primed MSCs or γMSCs"" are safe for patients with      moderate-to-severe asthma.      Patients will receive a single intravenous infusion of γMSCs at either 2x10^6 cells/kg or      5x10^6 cells/kg. Up to 12 young adults will be enrolled. The total sample size will not      exceed 24 participants.      The study will take place at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta (for patient activities) and at      Emory University (for laboratory research activities). Participants will be identified from      the asthma clinics at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. Participants will complete up to 12      visits over 1 year and will be compensated for their time and travel. At the completion of      the study, any samples remaining after experimentation will be de-identified and made      available for future research.      While some study participants may receive no direct benefit from participating in this study,      others may benefit from the close monitoring of their respiratory health, specialized asthma      education, and general evaluation of their condition, including lung function tests. Some      participants also achieve psychological benefit from participating in an important research      study and from interaction with the study staff. It is also possible that the knowledge      obtained from this study, such as identification of biomarkers, may assist in the creation of      novel asthma therapies in the future.    ",,"

Although great progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side      effects associated with transplantation,chronic graft-versus-host disease(cGVHD) remains an      important complication that occurs in about 50% patients. The mortality of cGVHD and its      complication could reach up to 50%,and cGVHD seriously influence the quality of life. At      present, the first line treatment of cGVHD remains in discussion.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and      treating GVHD after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of treatment of cGVHD remains      undetermined.

This study aims to explore the safety of      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) in the treatment of ACLF. The study      population is ACLF patients with 1-2 organ failures. To explore the safety of 3 doses of      UC-MSCs, 16 patients need to be enrolled. The main observation indicators are the short-term      and long-term safety of the treatment. All patients need to receive the standard medical      treatment (SMT) at the same time. Stem cell treatment is given by intravenous infusion on the      first, fourth, seventh, and tenth day. The occurrence of adverse events (AE) and serious      adverse events(SAE) before and after the infusion will be observed. After the patient is      discharged from the hospital, patients will be followed , the follow-up time is 5 years.    ","      Acute-on-chronic liver failure (acute-on-chronic liver failure, ACLF) is a special type of      rapid deterioration of liver function that occurs on the basis of cirrhosis or non-cirrhosis,      which is characterized by sequential multiple organ failure and high short-term (28 days)      mortality (15%). ACLF was first proposed by Jalan R and Williams R. in 2002. It is a newly      discovered type of critically ill liver disease characterized by high short-term mortality      after hospitalization [1]. At present, the pathophysiological mechanism of ACLF is not clear,      and its definition in Europe and Asia-Pacific is still controversial. However, severe      systemic inflammatory response is often closely related to the cause, accompanied by single      or multiple organ failure are three important characteristics of ACLF. In the past ten years,      the prevalence of ACLF has increased. Due to the rapid progress of the disease and the close      relationship between mortality and organ failure, there is no effective method to improve the      survival rate of ACLF patients except liver transplantation. The latest literature review      shows that the 28-day and 90-day mortality rates are as high as 27.8-37.6% and 40-,      respectively. 51.2%[2].      In 2013, European Association for the Study of Chronic Acute Liver Failure（EASL-CLIF）      conducted a prospective multi-center EASL-CLIF Chronic Acute Liver Failure (CANONIC) study in      29 liver disease treatment centers in eight European countries, and proposed chronic liver      failure-sequential organ failure assessment（CLIF-SOFA）score is used as the clinical      diagnostic criteria for alcoholic and hepatitis B virus（HBV）related ACLF. According to the      CLIF-SOFA score, the 90-day mortality rate of ACLF patients is as high as 51%, while that of      non-ACLF patients is 10% [3]. The European CANONIC study also shows that systemic      inflammation is the main driving force of multiple organ failure, which is a typical      pathogenesis of ACLF patients with western liver cirrhosis [4]. For another, the current      Asian ACLF diagnostic criteria is the Asia Pacific Association for the Study of Liver      Diseases (APASL) criteria, which reached a consensus in 2009, and the guidelines were      improved in 2014, but there is still a lack of multi-center, prospective evidence-based      medical evidence to support . In 2016, led by the person in charge of this project, an      oriental ACLF prospective multi-center observation cohort was established in China, which      included 3970 ACLF high-risk patients, filling the gap in the natural course and mortality of      oriental ACLF patients, and established a 90-day oriental ACLF diagnostic criteria for      mortality [5]. The person in charge of this project also explored the pathophysiological      mechanism of ACLF patients in areas with high prevalence of oriental HBV. The study showed      that submassive hepatic necrosis is an important histological feature in ACLF patients with      HBV-related cirrhosis. The systemic inflammatory response of multiple organ failure caused by      parenchymal liver cells has a similar mechanism to that of western alcoholic ACLF [6].      Although the causes of ACLF type are not the same in the East and the West, the cohorts from      the East and the West have confirmed the short-term high mortality rate of ACLF. Systemic      inflammation, sub-large necrosis, and aseptic inflammation may all important reasons that      lead to multiple organ failure and eventual death of ACLF patients.      Due to the high short-term mortality of ACLF and the limited liver source for liver      transplantation, exploring new methods for the treatment of ACLF is a major issue facing      clinical research. Mesenchymal stem cells have great application prospects in regenerative      medicine because of their strong self-renewal, low immunogenicity, non-tumorigenicity and      strong immune regulation ability[7]. Many previous documents have confirmed that mesenchymal      stem cells in animal models can promote liver cell regeneration, resist inflammation,      regulate local microenvironment and anti-fibrosis [8-10]. Among them, umbilical cord      mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSC) have attracted attention of researchers because they are      easily obtained from the medical waste-the umbilical cord, are not invasive, and have high      expansion capabilities in vitro [11]. The possible mechanism of UC-MSC in the treatment of      end-stage liver disease is that it can repair the liver. At present, there are the following      opinions: ① Cell rehabilitation. In the case of liver failure, MSC can differentiate into      hepatocytes and play an alternative therapeutic effect. A large number of studies have shown      that MSC can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in different inducing factors and      culture systems in vitro, capable of storing glycogen and urea synthesis. Function; ②Immune      regulation. Studies have shown that MSC can regulate immune cells by secreting a variety of      cytokines in the body, and play an immunomodulatory effect; ③Anti-fibrosis. MSC can induce      hepatic stellate cell apoptosis or inhibit its activation, and can secrete anti-fibrotic      substances such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor and matrix metallopeptidase      9（MMP-9）to reduce the deposition of extracellular matrix and inhibit the formation of liver      fibrosis.      According to the results of a single-center clinical trial published by the Third Affiliated      Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University in the previous period, there were no serious adverse      reactions at 6 hours and 72 weeks after intravenous infusion of MSCs. The dose was (1-6)*10^7      cells/time for 4 times, confirming the safety and effectiveness of both low-dose and      high-dose treatments. Another open clinical trial of Beijing 302 Hospital used mesenchymal      stem cells at a dose of 5*10^5 cells/kg (based on the patient's weight of 60kg, the dose was      3*10^7 cells/time), excluded severe ACLF patients accompanied by severe infections and other      sever complications. In addition, previous pharmacokinetic tests showed that the half-life of      mesenchymal stem cells in animals is 3 days.      Therefore, this research plans to carry out a single-center open clinical trial to confirm      the safety of umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the treatment of ACLF, and      provide stronger clinical evidence for the safety of UC-MSCs in the treatment of ACLF.

","      Results from recent clinical trials on bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) transplantation      show that this intervention can help reduce the incidence of heart failure (HF) after acute      myocardial infarction (AMI). However, no study has evaluated the effect of the      transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on a clinical endpoint such as HF.      This single-blinded, randomized, multicenter trial aims to establish whether the      intracoronary infusion of umbilical cord-derived Wharton's jelly MSCs (WJ-MSCs) helps prevent      HF development after AMI. The study will enroll 240 patients 3 to 7 days following an AMI      treated with primary percutaenous coronary intervention (PPCI). Only patients aged below 65      years with impaired LV function (LVEF < 40%) will be included. They will be randomized to      receive either a single intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs or standard care. The primary      outcome of this study is the assessment of HF development during long-term follow-up (four      years). Since the efficacy of MSCs is higher than BM-MNCs after AMI in the improvement of      LVEF, it would be probable that these cells may have a better clinical effect as well.      However, no study has evaluated the impact of the transplantation of MSCs on a clinical      endpoint such as HF. This study will help determine whether or not the infusion of      intracoronary WJ-MSCs in patients    ","      A randomized, multicenter, single-blinded phase III trial will be conducted to assess whether      the intracoronary infusion of umbilical cord WJ-MSCs demonstrates a superior effect in      reducing HF incidence following AMIs compared to standard treatment.      The sample size was determined with a 5% error, 80% power, a one-year HF incidence rate of      1.3-4%, and division between two groups in a 2:1 ratio (control:intervention), and a      three-year follow-up period.      A total of 360 patients with a history of an anterior ST-elevation MI (STEMI) successfully      reperfused within standard golden time within 3-7 days after AMI will be enrolled.      Randomization will be done via permuted block randomization through a web-based service. A      block size of 4 will be considered. Two groups of equal proportion will be formed, where only      one will receive an intracoronary infusion of WJ-MSCs besides the conventional therapy      provided to both groups. Those who assess the study outcomes will remain unaware of the      allocation (single-blind).      This study will use cGMP-certified clinical-grade human WJ-MSCs (Cell Tech Pharmed Co. Ltd.,      Tehran, Iran).In the intervention group, all 120 patients will receive a single intracoronary      infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs alongside the conventional treatment that will be provided to the      same number of patients in the control group. Patients in the intervention group will be      taken to the cardiac catheterization lab, where the infusion of 107 WJ-MSCs will be done      through the intracoronary route.      Before statistical analysis, adjudication of all measurements will be done by an experienced      cardiology department member excluded from the research group. The adjudicator will assess      the quality of each measurement and will exclude those with inadequate quality from the      analysis, where they will be regarded as missing. An independent, blinded safety committee      will evaluate potential major adverse cardiac events (MACEs). Once the adjudication process      is complete, the finalized database will be unblinded.      Data will be kept anonymous until analysis, which is to be performed by an independent      statistician external to the research group. Treatment efficacy will be assessed according to      the decrement in HF with the help of Cox regression analysis. The investigators will consider      the EF to have improved significantly if a minimum increment of 3% is achieved after six      months. The analysis will follow the intention-to-treat approach. The baseline      characteristics of the two study groups will also be compared. Continuous variables will be      summarized using the mean and standard deviation, while frequencies and percentages will be      given for categorical data. The EF, as the primary outcome, will be compared between the      study groups using the independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The      therapeutic effect will be estimated with a 95% CI. Two-sided P-values will be used. Safety      will be compared between the two groups according to the occurrence of MACEs (death,      recurrent AMI, ICD insertion, non-target vessel revascularization, etc.) and serious adverse      events (SAEs). These events will be followed over time with Kaplan-Meier curves, which will      allow us to understand their patterns. With the help of the Cox proportional hazards model,      The investigators will assess the statistical significance and 95% CI.

With the help of the Cox proportional hazards model,      The investigators will assess the statistical significance and 95% CI.      Adverse events will be reported by the study's executive committee to an independent Data and      Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). The DSMB will have the authority to stop the trial early      if patient safety is compromised or if the primary research objective is met. All safety      issues (unanticipated SAEs, mortality, intracoronary infusion complications, and severe      arrhythmias, etc.) will be monitored by the DSMB, and the DSMB statistician will report the      occurrence of safety issues in each study group quarterly. All deaths will be reported.      The investigators have discussed all ethical issues with the Institutional Review Board of      Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, which ultimately approved the study protocol      (IR.SUMS.REC.1400.409). Informed consent will be obtained once patients are clinically stable      and sedatives or strong analgesics do not alter their consciousness. Importantly, the use of      low balloon inflation pressure and divided (three-part) infusions will prevent complications      related to intracoronary cell infusion. The principles of the Declaration of Helsinki will be      upheld throughout this study.    ",,"

",      Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. There is a large unmet need for      safe and alternative therapeutic potions. This clinical trial is to inspect the efficiency      and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy for decompensated cirrhosis.    ,"      Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the      most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver      sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of      liver transplantation.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm,      which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be      isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas      and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and      self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many      diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.      In recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical      cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis,      primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs      therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation      rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other      investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that      treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees.      However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and      the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk      of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver      function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further      validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.      The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to      assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240      decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v.      transfusion 3 times of MSCs (6.0×10E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated      group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control      group.    ",,"

","      This is a single center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the      safety and efficacy of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell local intramuscular injection for      treatment of caesarean section uterine scars.    ","      In recent decades, the percentage of Cesarean section (CS) deliveries has dramatically      increased around the world. While it allows safe delivery in many situations, the risks of      severe maternal complications associated with cesarean delivery are higher than those      associated with vaginal delivery. These maternal complications include short term, long-term,      the next pregnancy, and the non-pregnant state, such as abnormal uterine bleeding and      postmenstrual spotting.      Uterine niche, also named cesarean scar defect, deficient cesarean scar, pouch, or      diverticulum, is defined as a triangular anechoic structure at the site of the scar or a gap      in the myometrium at the site of a previous caesarean section. It is one of the most common      complications associated with previous cesarean section. The primary clinical manifestation      is postmenstrual spotting, which may seriously affect the daily life of patients. The      treatment includes medical treatment, such as oral contraceptives, and surgical methods, such      as hysteroscopy resectoscopic correction, endometrial ablation, laparoscopic surgery, and      transvaginal repair surgery. Although good outcomes are reported in each study, present      treatments could not decrease the incidence among women after undergoing cesarean section.      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are long-lived cells with the ability of both self-renewal and      differentiation into multi-potential cells, such as osteoblasts, adipocytes and smooth muscle      cells. Trials with MSCs in patients after myocardial infarction have shown an excellent      safety and efficacy. In this trial, the investigators postulate that MSCs can reduce uterine      niche and convert scar tissue to viable myometrium. To test the hypothesis, the investigators      therefore undertake a Phase II clinical trial of the treatment for uterine niche among      primiparous women who undergo cesarean section.      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to investigate      the efficacy and safety of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells treatment on the caesarean      section uterine scars. A total of one hundred and twenty (120) participants will be      randomized (1:1) to receive direct local intramuscular injection of 1*10^7 MSCs (a dose of      1*10^7 cells in 1 ml of 0.9% saline) (MSCs group) or an identical-appearing 1ml of 0.9%      saline placebo (placebo-controlled group). Cesarean procedures and care will follow usual      practices. All participants will be performed by obstetricians from the investigators'      department using a unified double-layer uterine closure technique with a continuous      absorbable polyglycolic 1-0 suture. After suturing the uterine incision, direct local      intramuscular injection will be performed in the uterine incision as soon as possible on the      operating table.

","      Spina bifida, or myelomeningocele (MMC), is a disorder where the lower part of the spinal      cord of the fetus is exposed, meaning there is no bone or skin covering it. This is dangerous      because the spinal cord contains cells which control one's ability to move their legs and      walk, and also to be able to urinate and have bowel movements normally. One of the current      treatments for fetal MMC is to perform a surgery on the fetus before it is born which has      many names including in utero surgery, prenatal surgery, or fetal surgery. This is a surgery      that occurs inside the uterus (the womb) where the surgeon closes the opening in your fetus'      back to cover the exposed spinal cord.      Researchers have found that adding stem cells to the repair is effective in improving the      ability of animals with MMC to walk, and that the stem cells are safe in animal studies.      These stem cells are thought to protect the cells in the spinal cord that control movement      and developmental outcomes. This study is being performed to look at the safety and      effectiveness of stem cells on the fetus's exposed spinal cord during prenatal surgery.    ","      Historically, treatment of MMC was limited to post-natal surgery to close the dura and skin      over the spinal cord to prevent meningitis, which had no effect on motor function. The      potential benefit of earlier intervention was realized when prenatal ultrasound of patients      with MMC early in gestation revealed near-normal leg movements despite displaying paralysis      at birth. This finding gave credence to the two-hit hypothesis that paralysis was progressive      during prenatal life and suggested that fetal intervention could prevent the secondary damage      to the spinal cord. Fetal repair of MMC did confer improvement in motor function of children      treated in the Management of Myelomeningocele (MOMS) randomized controlled trial. The      promising results of the MOMS trial demonstrated the potential for improvement of paralysis      for these patients, but distal motor function still remained severely impaired in the      majority of patients with MMC with standard in utero repair alone. While this demonstrated      that the ideal time to intervene to prevent paralysis is in utero with the goal of preventing      the accrual of ongoing damage to the spinal cord, there is still room for improvement. The      remarkable regenerative capacity of the fetal environment combined with regenerative capacity      of placental mesenchymal stem cells offers potential for augmentation of the fetal repair of      MMC with a novel therapy to further reduce and repair the sustained spinal cord damage.

As in the current standard fetal surgery, under sonographic guidance, initial uterine entry will be accomplished by uterine stapling device or similar. The fetus will be given an intramuscular injection of pain medications and paralytic. The myelomeningocele will be closed in a standardized manner under magnification. As in the standard fetal operation, the spinal cord will be dissected from surrounding tissue and allowed to drop into the spinal canal. The PMSC-ECM product will then be tailored to the size of the spinal cord and applied topically, cell side down. The PMSC-ECM product will be sutured in place to the dura. Finally, the fetal skin will be closed in the standard fashion. The amniotic fluid volume will be replaced and antibiotics will be added. The uterus will be closed. The abdominal fascial layer and skin will be closed in routine fashion.

","      This is a non-randomized, single arm, single center, phase I/II study of AloCelyvir in      subjects with mUM to the liver, the main site for M1 in this disease. This study is divided      into 3 phases: Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. After informed consent is obtained,      subjects will enter in the Screening phase to assess eligibility criteria and perform a      mandatory tumor biopsy. Upon meeting criteria, eligible subjects will be entered into the      Treatment phase. Patients will receive AloCelyvir in weekly intravenous infusions at doses of      0.5x106 cells/kg for 8 weeks. After 4 first treatment doses a new tumor biopsy will be      mandatory. Treatment will be maintained for 2 months (8 weeks) but can be stopped earlier if      disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Subjects that are no      longer receiving AloCelyvir will enter the Follow-up phase. Subjects that are no longer      receiving AloCelyvir because of unacceptable toxicity or due to investigator judgment will      undergo radiological evaluations of the tumor every 8 weeks during the first 12 months (48      weeks), and then every 12 weeks until the progression of disease (progression follow-up).      Subjects that are no longer receiving Alocelyvir because of progression will enter the long      term OS follow-up until their death or until the end of the study, whatever happens before.      Subjects who have switched to an alternative treatment without disease progression will      receive a formal follow-up with images tests until progression, and after progression long      term follow up to record the date of death.    ","      0. Background:      Uveal melanoma (UM) is an orphan neoplasm but it is the most common primary intraocular      malignant tumor in adults. Global overall survival (OS) at 5 years is lower than 50%. This      elevated mortality rate is caused by a high incidence of metastases, and lack of active      therapy. The metastatic behavior differs from cutaneous melanoma (CM) given the purely      hematogenous dissemination and the tendency to metastasize to the liver 3. When liver      metastases develop, life expectancy is reduced to 8-9 months. Chemotherapy treatment is      unsuccessful in metastatic UM (mUM) and results in less than 5% overall response rate (ORR).      There is no proof that chemotherapy prolongs survival and the 5-year survival rate of      patients with UM has not improved in 25 years . New targeted therapies have not improved      results.      The PULSE-UM study plans to treat mUM patients with an advanced therapy that seeks to      activate the immune system and to study the mUM immune-environment in different ways to      identify new immunotherapy targets.        1. Overview of study design.           This is a single arm, single center, phase I/II study of AloCelyvir in subjects with           metastatic uveal melanoma with liver disease. This study is divided into 3 phases:           Screening, Treatment, and Follow-up. After informed consent is obtained, subjects will           enter the Screening phase to assess eligibility criteria and perform a mandatory tumor           biopsy. Upon meeting criteria, eligible subjects will be entered into the Treatment           phase. Patients will receive a weekly infusion of AloCelyvir. New tumor biopsy will be           mandatory and performed around day +28 +/- 3 days (week 4). Treatment will be           administered for 8 consecutive weeks but can be stopped because disease progression,           unacceptable toxicity or patient withdrawal. Subjects that have finished the 8-weeks           period or has stopped the treatment because of unacceptable toxicity or due to           investigator judgment will enter the follow-up phase (firstly for PFS until progression           and lately long term follow-up until death).           Subjects that have finished the 8-weeks period or has stopped the treatment because of           unacceptable toxicity or due to investigator judgment will undergo radiological           evaluations of the tumor every 8 weeks during the first 12 months (48 weeks), and then           every 12 weeks until the progression of disease (progression follow-up). Also, patients           that have received at least 1 dose of AloCelyvir will also initiate the safety           evaluations. Safety evaluations will performed be every 8 weeks during the first 12           months (48 weeks).           Subjects that are no longer receiving AloCelyvir because of progression will enter the           long term OS follow-up until their death or until the end of the study (whatever happens           before).           Subjects who have switched to an alternative treatment without disease progression will           receive a formal follow-up with images tests until progression, and after progression           long term follow up to record the date of death.        2. Screening phase.           Screening will occur between Day -28 and Day 0 that is before first treatment           administration. The purpose of the screening period is to establish protocol           eligibility, as specified in the inclusion/exclusion criteria.           Informed consent of study procedures and tumor biopsy sample should be obtained prior to           the 28-day screening window after the study has been fully explained to each subject, in           order to permit tumor biopsy sample acquisition and analysis prior to enrollment.           If laboratory or imaging procedures were performed for alternate reasons prior to           signing consent, these can be used for screening purposes with consent of the patient.           However, all screening laboratory and imaging results must have been obtained within 28           days of enrollment.           A mandatory fresh tumor tissue from liver biopsies before starting therapy, to compare           stromal cell populations after combination treatment with AloCelyvir should be collected           during screening visit (after informed consent is signed by the patient) and managed           according to what is detailed in the laboratory manual. The collection of baseline tumor           biopsies and around day +28 (week 4) is mandated unless the procedure confers a risk to           the patient. The collection of tumor biopsies at the time of progression is optional but           strongly encouraged.           Results of screening assessments must be obtained prior to the first dose of study drug           (Cycle 1/Day 1). Assessments may be performed on Day -1 or on Cycle 1/Day 1 prior to           dosing. Clinical laboratory tests including pregnancy test (where applicable) can be           performed within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study drug. Subjects who complete           the baseline visit and continue meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria will begin the           treatment phase of this study.        3. Treatment phase.           The treatment phase will begin at the time of enrolment of the first patient and will           consist in 2 cycles of 4 weeks (28 days). The treatment phase will end when the last           patient finishes treatment plant.           Once registered and having received the confirmation of enrolment form from eCRF,           subjects will receive a weekly IV infusion of AloCelyvir 0.5x106 cells/kg.           Treatment will continue for 8 weeks or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable           toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another discontinuation criterion is met. Any grade           3 or grade 4 toxicity according to CTCAE criteria will be discussed in a safety           committee formed by Principal Investigator, the head of UICEC Pharmacovigilance Team and           the Clinical Trial Unit at IDIBELL. This committee will deem the toxicity as           unacceptable or not.           Every effort should be made to minimize the time between enrollment and starting           treatment. (i.e. within 2 day of enrollment).           An additional mandatory fresh tumor tissue from liver biopsies on day +28 +/- 3 days           should be collected to compare stromal cell populations after combination treatment           AloCelyvir. Management of sample is detailed in the laboratory manual.           Results for LFTs, full blood count, and creatinine must be available before commencing           an infusion of AloCelyvir, and reviewed by the treating physician or Investigator prior           to dosing/dispensing.           Subjects will be visited by Investigators every other week during the treatment phase,           to closely follow up toxicity. Patients should be visited at least every month           thereafter and every time that Principal Investigator deemed necessary.           Subjects will undergo radiological evaluations of the tumor every 8 weeks during the           first 48 weeks and then, every 12 weeks until disease progression. This schedule MUST be           followed regardless of any delays in dosing or end of treatment due to other reason than           disease progression.           Safety assessments will be performed at each visit and include patient interview and           reviewing of additional source documentation such as investigations, medical history and           concomitant medications, as needed.        4. End of treatment visit.           The visit scheduled 4 weeks after AloCelyvir last planned dose will be considered the           end-oftreatment visit. This visit should be scheduled for 28 +/-3 days after the end of           treatment for any reason.        5. Progression (PFS) follow up.           Patients that end treatment due to any reason other than disease progression, according           to RECIST 1.1, will follow tumor evaluations every 8 weeks (up to week 48) and every 12           weeks or clinically indicated thereafter, until disease progression.        6. Long term follow-up phase.           All patients (both, after disease progression or in the case that patients have switched           to an alternative treatment without documented progression), should be followed until           death or study closure. Date and reason of death should be documented consistently in           patient record and in the eCRF.        7. Study oversight for safety evaluation.      This protocol will contain a safety part followed by an expansion part. The first 3 patients      will be included in the safety part. Due to lack of standard treatment and dismal prognostic      in this disease, no time restriction between patient enrollment will be applied.      When all these 3 patients received at least 4 AloCelyvir administrations, the Principal      Investigator together with the head of the Pharmacovigilance Team of the UICEC and the      Clinical Trial Unit at IDIBELL will discuss and review the reported toxicity. If no grade 3      or grade 4 toxicity was presented, the safety part will be closed and then the expansion part      will begin. If a grade 3 toxicity was presented and after the team evaluation, another 3      patients will be included in the safety part. The same toxicity evaluation will be applied in      this new safety part.      Patients in both the safety and the expansion part will have a weekly visit during treatment      phase followed by the end-of-treatment visit. Onwards, all patient will enter in the      progression follow-up phase. In this phase, along with the progression visits, patients will      also have the safety evaluation. Safety evaluations will be performed every 8 weeks (after      the las dose of AloCelyvir) during the first 48 weeks.      A subject may elect to discontinue AloCelyvir at any time for safety, medical, or personal      reasons. Patients who choose to discontinue study drug prior to the end of the 8-weeks      treatment period will be followed in the progression follow up period and continue to undergo      regularly scheduled disease assessment until documentation of disease progression or start of      an alternative anticancer treatment. Also, patients that have received at least 1 dose of      AloCelyvir will also initiate the safety evaluations.      All subjects will be followed for overall survival and all post progression cancer treatments      administered will be recorded. Subjects may at any time, withdraw consent for further study      participation. A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by mail,      phone, or other means as much as possible to gather information such as the reason for      failure to return and the status of treatment compliance, presence or absence of adverse      events, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms, and the information will be recorded in      the eCRF.      Subjects who early withdrew from the study or treatment will be discontinued for 1 of these      primary reasons: adverse event(s), lost to follow-up, subject choice, progressive disease, or      administrative/other. In addition to the primary reason, the subject may have indicated 1 or      more of these reasons as secondary reasons for discontinuation. Study disposition information      will be collected on the appropriate eCRF. A subject removed from the study for any reason      may not be replaced.      Safety will be assessed by monitoring and recording all AEs including all CTCAE grades (for      both increasing and decreasing severity) and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular      monitoring of hematology and clinical chemistry; physical examinations; and regular      measurement of vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs) as detailed in the schedule of      visits and procedures.      Safety evaluation will be performed by PI in each visit, all findings will be collected in      the eCRF and, when applicable, will be expedited informed to Sponsor according to what is      detailed in Assessment of Safety section. Coordinating Investigator will be the principal      contact in IDIBELL for pharmacovigilance surveillance and will be informed by the UICEC of      each new SAE received and will participate on the management of study emergent toxicities.      Furthermore, a monthly report with all new SAE reported by sites will be distributed both, to      sites and Sponsor. Annual Safety Reports (DSUR) will be elaborated with the cumulative safety      information of the trial and submitted to Coordinating Investigator, Sponsor and Industry      Partner, before sending to Competent Authorities as required by current regulation for      clinical trials.      Additionally, the Principal Investigator together with the head of the Pharmacovigilance Team      of the UICEC and the Clinical Trial Unit at IDIBELL will meet monthly to discuss all SAEs      reported . They will meet also every time a Grade 3-4-5 toxicity is reported to asses      causality to AloCelyvir and oversight safety profile of the Study. Also, the will meet after      the 3 first patients in the safety part of the study have received the first 4 infusions of      AloCelyvir.      If at any time safety profile of the study is not acceptable, corrective measures will be      implemented by the Sponsor, otherwise the study would be halted.    ",,"

","Overall response rate6 monthsObjective Response Rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with at least one visit response of CR or PR that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later. Where PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters as long as criteria for PD are not met and CR is disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a reduction in short axis to <10mm.Following RECIST 1.1 criteria, for non-randomised trials where response is the primary endpoint, confirmation of PR and CR is required to ensure responses identified are not the result of measurement error. ORR defined in this manner is a direct measure of drug antitumor activity, which can be evaluated in a single-arm study, providing an accurate assessment of a subrogate efficacy endpoint.","

","      This early phase I trial is to find out the effect of adding cord blood tissue-derived      mesenchymal stromal cells (cb-MSCs) to ruxolitinib in treating patients with acute graft      versus host disease that does not respond to steroid therapy (steroid-refractory).      Ruxolitinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for      cell growth. cb-MSCs are a type of tissue helper cell that can be removed from donated      umbilical cord blood tissue and grown into many different cell types that can be used to      treat cancer and other disease, such as graft versus host disease. This trial aims to learn      if adding cb-MSCs to ruxolitinib may help control steroid-refractory acute graft versus host      disease.    ","      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:      I. To estimate between-arm differences (Arm 3 versus [vs] Arm 1, and Arm 2 vs Arm 1) for each      of the 28-day co-primary outcome probabilities.      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.      ARM 1: Patients receive ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for at least 3 days and may      consider tapering after 6 months of therapy if response occurs and therapeutic corticosteroid      doses have been discontinued.      ARM 2: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive lower dose of      cb-MSCs intravenously (IV) for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4      consecutive weeks for 8 total doses.      ARM 3: Patients receive ruxolitinib PO BID as in Arm 1. Patients also receive higher dose of      cb-MSCs IV for up to 60 minutes twice weekly (at least 3 days apart) over 4 consecutive weeks      for 8 total doses.      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on day 28 and then for up to 6      months.    ",,"

","      The clinical study with UMC119-06-05 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with      frailty syndrome. This will be a dose escalation, open label, single-center study in adult      with frailty syndrome. UMC119-06-05 is ex vivo cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived      mesenchymal stem cells product which is intended for treatment of frailty syndrome.    ","      Frailty syndrome is the most problematic expression of population ageing and profound      implications for the planning and delivery of health and social care when population ageing      is accelerating rapidly worldwide, from 461 million people older than 65 years in 2004 to an      estimated 2 billion people by 2050 . Frailty syndrome characterized by a progressive decline      in health and clinical symptoms of exhaustion, weight loss, a feeling of slowing down, and a      decrease in functional capacity. Frailty is a common clinical syndrome in older adults that      carries an increased risk for poor health outcomes including falls, incident disability,      hospitalization, and mortality. Health study as meeting three out of five phenotypic      criteria: low grip strength, self-reported exhaustion, slowed walking speed, low physical      activity, and unintentional weight loss. Frailty is a disorder of several inter-related      physiological systems, including genetic and environmental factors in combination with      epigenetic mechanisms, which regulate the differential expression of genes in cells and could      be especially important in ageing. Current interventions focus on interdisciplinary      approaches which include nutritional supplementation, physical exercise, and cognitive      intervention. Clinical studies of these preventative approaches have shown inconsistent and      modest benefits, further highlighting the unmet clinical need. Therefore, development of new      therapeutic modalities to improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis of frailty syndrome in      adult patients is of urgent need. A variety of pharmacologic and biologic therapies are      currently being tested to treat aging. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies,      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) are represents an attractive option that addresses the      pathophysiology of the syndrome.    ",,"

","      Symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is a serious public health problem in the world, it carries a      high personal, social and economic impact. Currently, there are no drugs that modify the      natural course of the disease. As analgesic therapy becomes insufficient, more invasive      measures are applied, ultimately leading to arthroplasty.      The scientific community has joined efforts to develop new therapeutic approaches that allow      the delay and regeneration of injured tissue in these patients. These include cell therapy      with mesenchymal stem cells derived from different sources. Although most of the clinical      studies carried out in different parts of the world with this therapy in patients with knee      osteoarthritis have shown therapeutic benefit, it is necessary to develop clinical trials      with high quality in our population.      The aim of this project is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and efficacy of Cellistem-OA      (biological therapy based on mesenchymal stem cells derived from Wharton's jelly of umbilical      cord) in patients with knee osteoarthritis in the Colombian population.      Investigators proposed to carry out an experimental (clinical trial), randomized, controlled      and parallel with 30 participants with knee knee osteoarthritis of the medical complex      Fundación Oftalmológica de Santander Clínica Carlos Ardila Lulle. The participants will be      randomized into two groups: i) 15 patients who will receive a dose of 2 x 106 Cellistem-OA      and ii) 15 patients who will receive an active comparator (acetonide of triamcinolone 10mg /      mL), which will be administered by intra-articular injection in the superolateral aspect of      the knee. The outcomes to be evaluated will be: (i) decrease in joint pain, (ii) increase in      joint functionality, (iii) improvement in quality of life and (iv) improvement of articular      cartilage. These parameters will be evaluated at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 25, 28, 32, 36 and 52      post-treatments. Additionally, local and systemic adverse events will be recorded to      establish whether or not there is an association between them and the intervention.    ","      Type of study Controlled, randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing CELLISTEM-OA and      active comparator (triamcinolone acetonide).      Study population Patients from the Fundación Oftalmológica de Santander Clínica Carlos Ardila      Lulle who consult the trauma and rheumatology service by knee osteoarthritis. Patients who      show interest in participating will be cited to an interview with the researchers where both      the objectives and the research procedures will be explained.      Sample size The sample size considered are 30 participants distributed in two groups.

","      This is a single site, prospective study of one intravenous infusion of human umbilical cord      tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hCT-MSC) in toddlers with autism spectrum disorder      (ASD). Toddlers 18 to 48 months of age with a confirmed diagnosis of ASD will be eligible to      participate. Diagnosis will be confirmed at the time of the eligibility visit at the Duke      Center for Autism and Brain Development. All participants will receive a single intravenous      dose of 2x106/kg hCT-MSC per kilogram at baseline. Assessments will be conducted at baseline      and 6 months, with remote follow-up assessments at 12 months.    ","      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and feasibility. Safety assessments      include monitoring of acute infusion reactions, adverse events, incidence of infections, and      markers of alloimmunization. Clinical outcome measures will also be described. A key clinical      outcome measeure is the change in social communication abilities from baseline to 6 months      based on the Joint Engagement Rating Inventory (JERI), a commonly-used and well-validated      coding system for rating the quality and quantity of social communication skills in toddlers      with and without ASD.91 JERI coding rates social communication abilities on a 1 to 7 scale      and factors in both the quantity and quality of skills. The total joint engagement score as      well as ratings on all JERI subscales that comprise the total score will be described.      Other clinical endpoints will include the PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) autism composite      score, the mean of the Socialization Subscale Standard Score and Communication Subscale      Standard Score on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS-3), the Clinical Global      Impression Scale (CGI) - Severity and Improvement Scales, the Communicative Development      Inventories (CDI-2): Words & Sentences subscales, attention abilities via eye-tracking, and      brain activity.

","      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous      dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hCT-MSC) in adults      with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSC is a cell product isolated from umbilical cord      tissue. The cells from the cord tissue are processed and expanded in the laboratory and then      infused intravenously in a single dose per participant. Participants will be ages 18-35      years, with ASD and a full-scale IQ >70 without an identified genetic cause of autism.      Participants will have remote follow up visits at 3 and 12 months and an in-person visit at 6      months. In addition to the primary endpoints evaluating safety, the study will include      secondary and exploratory endpoints evaluating Autism Spectrum Disorder specific outcome      measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after hCT-MSC administration.    ","      This is a prospective, open label, phase one study to determine the safety and tolerability      of a single intravenous dose of Human Umbilical Cord Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells      (hCT-MSC) in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). hCT-MSCs are manufactured from      umbilical cord tissue donated by healthy mothers delivering full term babies via Cesarean      Section. The cells are extracted from the cord tissue, expanded and cryopreserved (frozen).      One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each      participant in this study.      It is hypothesized that immune dysregulation and/or abnormal neuronal connectivity that      adversely affects normal brain development may cause core symptomatology observed in      individuals with ASD. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have demonstrated a multitude of      immunomodulatory effects which are thought to be carried out via paracrine and trophic      signaling. While MSCs modulate the immune response, MSCs themselves have low immunogenicity      (the body does not have a strong immune reaction against them) and they do not permanently      engraft in the recipient.      Adults ages 18 to 35 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will      have a screening visit that includes clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD,      cognitive abilities, ASD symptom level, and confirmation of eligibility.      One dose of 2x10^6 cells/kg (maximum of 10 x 10^7) will be administered intravenously to each      participant at a baseline visit. Participants will be admitted to the infusion center on the      day of their baseline visit and vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature,      respiratory rate) will be measured. Participants may require some sedation prior to IV      placement if they are unable to remain still or cooperate. A peripheral IV will be placed and      prior to the infusion, premedications (Benadryl, Solumedrol, 0.5mg/kg each) will be      administered. The hCT-MSCs product will be administered intravenously over 30-60 minutes.      Pulse oximetry will be monitored continuously throughout the infusion and IV fluid      maintenance will be given. Participants will be discharged after 1 hour, providing all vital      signs are at their baseline and they are asymptomatic with no evidence of toxicity.      Participants will be evaluated the day after the infusion to assess for any infusion-related      adverse reactions or complications. A phone call or email to the participant or legally      authorized representative to assess safety of the infusion will occur 7-10 days after the      infusion. Remote follow up will occur 3 months and one year after infusion. Participants will      return to Duke six months after infusion for repeated testing and safety follow-up. The      Medical and Behavioral History Questionnaire assessing adverse events will be obtained at      baseline, 3, 6 and 12-months.      The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions, incidence of infections, and      markers of alloimmunization will be assessed. Key secondary endpoints will include      ASD-specific outcome measures to describe any changes in autism symptoms after product      administration. Exploratory analyses will include measures obtained by EEG, eye-tracking,      pupillary light reflex, computer vision analysis, and tactile stimulation.    ",,"

In      the previous three-arm randomized clinical trial involving women with primiparous singleton      pregnancies, the investigators found umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells was not      significantly different from placebo for the reduction of cesarean section skin scar and did      not increase recognition of participants'satisfaction at the sixth month follow-up. Although      there was no statistical difference, the trial study found that the total vancouver scar      scale rating was lower with the dose increased.      Some studies have suggested that it usually took 18-24 months for a typical scar matures. In      this trial, the investigators want to continue to investigate the efficacy of perinatal      tissue mesenchyme stem cells treatment on the appearance of a caesarean scar as compared to a      similar untreated scar at the three years follow-up.

","Vancouver Scar Scale scoreThree years post treatmentThe investigators measured scar at three years post treatment using Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS). The VSS included vascularity (normal, pink, red, or purple), pigmentation (normal, hypopigmented, mixed, or hyperpigmented), height (flat, < 2 mm, 2-5 mm, or > 5 mm), and pliability (normal, supple, yielding, firm, ropes, or contracture). Each variable contained ranked subscales that could be summed to obtain a total score ranging from 0 to 14, with 0 representing normal skin and a higher score representing a more marked or abnormal scar. The Chinese version of the VSS has been shown to have good intraclass correlations and Cronbach's α measures. All scars will be assessed independently by two observers on the same day when the participants are lying in a supine position with the scar exposed in bright light. If the data varies, another researcher will be required to assess the scar at the same day and the results with the highest frequency will be recorded.","

According to the comprehensive standardized      prevalence estimation in 2016, 12.42 million people older than 40 years in China are      currently suffering from stroke or have ever suffered from stroke. The overall prevalence      rate of stroke in China was 1,596 per 100,000 people in 2016, 4.6 times higher than the rate      of 345.1 per 100,000 people in 2013 and 70% of the survivors have disabilities in varying      degrees. In addition to rehabilitation therapy, there is no therapeutic drugs of remarkable      curative effect for the treatment of ischemic stroke patients. The latest data show that the      annual recurrence rate of ischemic stroke in China is as high as 17.7%.      Allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells have been used in many clinical studies for different      diseases. In addition to differentiating into multiple cell types and promoting the recovery      and repair of the brain by replacing damaged cells, mesenchymal stem cells also secrete      cytokines and neurotrophic factors to support and stimulate the growth of other endogenous      cells. Meanwhile, mesenchymal stem cells also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory      functions. These characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells provide a new therapy for the      treatment of stroke.    ",,"

","      Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common hereditary retinal disorder (accounts for 20% of      children attending blind schools in Pakistan) which causes degeneration of rod and cone      photoreceptors. Rods and cones largely depend on the retinal pigment epithelium for their      proper functioning. Various growth factors and their receptors are present in retinal      epithelium and a number of genes are responsible for the production of these growth factors.      Genetic mutation in any of these genes causes retinal degeneration by progressive loss of      retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. The disease initially starts with night      blindness and leads to the loss of central vision and eventually total blindness. To date,      there is no definitive cure for patients suffering from RP. Recently, stem cell based      therapies have shown great promise for the management of RP. It is well documented that      umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UMSCs) have the ability to release various      paracrine and immunomodulatory factors that are similar to those synthesized by retinal      pigment epithelium. Multiple routes including systemic (intravenous) and localized      (subretinal, intravitreal, suprachoroidal and sub-tenon) have been employed to administer      UMSCs for the management of RP. It is important to note that deep sub-tenon region (space      between the sclera and the conjunctiva) acts as both natural culture medium for cells and as      immune privileged site because of avascularity of the region. It has been reported that the      injection of UMSCs in sub-tenon space of human subjects have improved the visual acuity even      after 1 year post-injection. In addition, the injection of UMSCs in suprachoroidal space      enhances the entry of growth factors released by the cells into choroidal flow and maintain      the constant growth factors secretion to the choroidal and retinal tissues. Limoli and      colleagues were the first to report the suprachoroidal administration of cells being the safe      mode of cell delivery with no complications. The present study is aimed to investigate the      safety and therapeutic efficacy of UMSC injection employing two different routes (sub-tenon      injection versus suprachoroidal injection) for the treatment of RP in human subjects.    ","      Isolation and characterization of human umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells      (UMSCs): The culturing and characterization of UMSCs will be performed as documented by Ali      and colleagues. Briefly, human umbilical cord tissues along with informed consent forms will      be collected from COVID-19- and hepatitis B, C virus-negative women with healthy pregnancies      during the Cesarean Section surgery after completion of gestation period. The umbilical cord      tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing      penicillin and streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with      4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15ml PBS. The cord will then      gently scrap with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be      cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord      arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced      pieces will be incubated in 17.5ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in      serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50ml conical tube for ~3 hrs in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity      at 37oC. After ~3 hrs, the digested lysate will be passed through strainer and will be      diluted three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two      T-25cm2 flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37o C. The      flasks will be fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic      solution) every third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will      be transferred in two T-75cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UMSCs at P3 will      be characterized using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be employed for      injection in RP patients.    ",,"

","      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by      selective and progressive loss of motor neurons. Disease progression leads to death within      2-4 years, but there exists no definite treatment so far.      Based on phase I/II clinical trial(NCT01363401), twice intrathecal autologous bone      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Lenzumestrocel) injections showed significant      therapeutic benefit lasting at least six months with safety in patients with ALS.      Additionally, the switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory conditions, which was indicated from      the inverse correlation between TGF-β1 and MCP-1 levels after Lenzumestrocel injections in      the good responder, has been considered a plausible beneficial action mechanism.      This study is designed to investigate the following. First, to reconfirm and evaluate the      long-term efficacy of twice injections (single cycle) of Lenzumestrocel, group 1 will receive      a single cycle injection with a 26-day interval.      Second, to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Lenzumestrocel repeated injections,      group 2 will receive a single cycle injection a 26-day apart followed by three times      injections every three-month interval.

at 12 months, 6 months
ALSFRS-R is an instrument designed to evaluate functional status of subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), such as gross motor activity, fine motor activity, bulbar function and respiration function. It consists of 12 items; 3 items for mouth functions, 4 items for upper limb and overall fine motor functions, 2 items for lower limb functions and 3 items for respiration functions. Each item is evaluated in 5-point scale (0~4). A higher score means a better functional status.

They include a close vigilance for, and stringent reporting of selected local and systemic reactions, adverse events including serious adverse events.After 4th rehabilitation visit to study termination, only AEs of special interest and serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal from the study and concomitant medications used to treat adverse events will be collected. The AEs of special interest related directly to the state of the knee after intraarticular administration will be: excessive warming of the knee, pain, suffusion, hematoma, knee locking, decrease ROM.The prevalence, duration and severity of AEs of special interest will be additionally analyzed in the study., Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-upThe numerical scale is one of the most commonly used pain scales in medicine. The NRS consists of a numeric version of the visual analog scale. It is labeled from 0 to 10, with 0 being ""no pain"" and 10 being ""the worst pain imaginable"". This scale can help guide the diagnostic process, track the progression of the pain, and more.Patients will report intensity of pain only in knee subjected to the treatment in the study., Change in joint swellingMonth 3 and Month 6 Follow-upEvaluation the joint swelling during physical examination by 4-items scale: none, mild, moderate, severe. Joint swelling will be assessed only knee subjected to the treatment in the study., Change in the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)Month 6 Follow-upSF-36 is an oft-used, well-researched, self-reported measure of health. The SF-36 is often used as a measure of a person or population's quality of life. It comprises 36 questions which cover eight domains of health: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); 8) general health perceptions., Change in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-upChange in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures.Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by KOOS survey., Change in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC 2000)Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-upChange in IKDC Questionnaire score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by IKDC 2000 survey.","
Change in cartilage morphology

Minimum, maximum and average weight-bearing value (measured in kilograms, kg) of the left and right lower extremity will be recorded.
It is expected that predicted lower limb loading asymmetry in patients will transform to symmetry after MSCs treatment and rehabilitation.
,
Change in Range of motion (ROM)
Month 6 Follow-up
Measurement of knee flexion and extension angles (in degrees, °). Normal ROM at the knee is considered to be 0 degrees of extension (completely straight knee joint) to 135 degrees of flexion (fully bent knee joint).
Knee flexion angle, knee extension angle, knee hyperextension (if yes, hyperextension angle), hip range of motion (normal/abnormal) will be evaluated in left and right lower extremity.
,
Change in ultrasonographic findings in knee joint
Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-up
During ultrasound examination, the volume of effusion (mL) will be assessed. The lateral and medial meniscus, lateral and medial knee, and patellofemoral joint will be evaluated (normal/abnormal; if abnormal, details are needed).

","      At present, a number of projects related to MSCs have been approved for graft-versus-host      disease, myocardial infarction, Crohn's disease and other diseases, indicating a strong      therapeutic potential of MSCs. However, the efficacy of MSC-Exo for severely infected      children is not fully evaluated. In our study, patients who met the inclusion criteria will      be divided into trial group and control group. Clinical and demographic data, as well as      treatment outcome will be collected from the electronic health record. This study will      evaluate the application and therapeutic effect of MSC-Exo in severely infected children, and      determine the Optimal dosage and infusion.    ","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent stem cells with high self-renewal ability and      multidirectional differentiation potential. studies revealed that local or systemic      administration of mesenchymal stem cell-derivrd exosomes (MSC-Exo) efficiently suppressed      detrimental immune response in inflamed tissues and promoted survival and regeneration of      injured parenchymal cells. European Union countries have written MSCs into treatment      guidelines for refractory graft-versus-host disease.      In China, the technology for isolation, in vitro culture and expansion of MSCs is already      mature. With further research on the therapeutic efficacy of MSC-Exo and the development of      clinical trials, it is expected to become a treatment for severe illness.      A predictable infection plan is going to be widely used in clinics to provide individualized      treatment for patients, improve the prognosis of patients and improve the quality of life.      The investigators intend to enroll all children who were hospitalized in pediatric intensive      care unit PICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 2022 to December 2023.      Children with a PICU length of day less than 48h will be excluded.    ",,"

The total score, ranging from 0 to 24, arises from the sum of all single organ scores using the first measured value of the day. Intervals for the most abnormal value of each variable were constructed on a scale from 0 to 4 so that a value of 0 represented essentially normal function and was associated with an ICU mortality rate of < 5%, whereas a value of 4 represented marked functional derangement and an ICU mortality rate of > or = 50%., the age, PaO2/FlO2, and plateau pressure score (APPS)Within 3 to 15 days after the start of treatmentThe APPS is a 9-point score that is calculated by measuring the age, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, and plateau pressure at 24 h after the patient is diagnosed with moderate to severe ARDS and counting each one to 1-3. Since many variables are not needed for calculations, clinicians can easily predict the in-hospital mortality of mechanically ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS patients at bedside.","

","      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT: AGLE-102 is an allogeneic derived extracellular vesicle (EV) product      derived from normal donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).      INDICATION AND RATIONALE: The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of      AGLE-102 in the treatment of lesions in subjects with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.    ","      STUDY DESIGN: This is a phase 1/2A, non randomized, multi-center, ascending dose, study to      assess the effectiveness and safety of AGLE-102 on lesions in subjects with EB.      Eligible subjects will undergo a one-month observation period to confirm that the targeted      wound is chronic (only single wounds with evidence of less than 20% closure over that period      will be eligible for treatment). Once this has been established, up to 6 administrations of      BM-MSC EVs will occur, at each to be given over a period of no more than 3 months. A maximum      of 50 cm2 in total wound surface will be treated, and each administration will occur 14 days      (+/- 7 days) but no less than 7 days apart. If the wound closes prior to 6 administrations,      no additional doses will be given. Wound closure will be determined by complete      re-epithelialization that is not subject to re-injury during dressing changes or as a result      of normal daily activities (e.g. wearing clothing, eating, sleeping). After the 6 doses of      BM-MSC EVs are given, the wound will be followed monthly for a period of 4 months to the      termination of the study at 8 months or, in the event the wound closes before receiving all 6      doses, for 4 month after the wound closes. The ARANZ SilhouetteStarTM will be used to measure      the target lesion at all visits.      STUDY OBJECTIVES:      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to determine the safety of applying single      administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to DEB wounds      between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine the safety of applying      multiple administrations of 2 ascending dose levels of EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs to      DEB wounds between 10 and 50 cm2 that have persisted for more than one month and to determine      if there is clinical benefit (>50% closure) of applying BM-MSC EVs to DEB wounds      PLANNED SAMPLE SIZE: 10 subjects will be treated on the protocol with AGLE-102.

",      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common and chronic lung disease that occurs in preterm      infants following ventilator and oxygen therapy and is associated with long-term health      consequences. Preclinical research shows that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) can modify a      number of pathophysiological processes that are central to the progression of BPD and thus      present as a promising new treatment option. The main purpose of this Phase I study is to      evaluate the safety of human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs in extremely preterm infants      at risk of developing BPD.    ,"      Complications of extreme preterm birth are the primary cause of mortality in children under      the age of five. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease that follows      ventilator and oxygen therapy for acute respiratory failure, is the most common complication      of extreme prematurity and contributes to life-long respiratory and neurological impairment.      Currently, there is no effective treatment for BPD. The multi-factorial nature of BPD makes      it challenging for traditional pharmacological therapies targeting a single pathway to have a      major impact on outcome. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may provide a promising new      treatment avenue due to their pleiotropic effects that may prevent neonatal lung injury while      promoting lung (and other organ) growth. A systematic review and meta-analysis of all      preclinical studies testing MSCs in neonatal lung injury models provides strong evidence for      the lung protective effect of MSCs. Additionally, studies in a large preclinical model of      extreme prematurity and chronic lung injury suggest feasibility, safety and short-term      hemodynamic benefit of intravenously delivered human umbilical cord tissue-derived MSCs      (uc-MSC).      The aim of this study is to establish the safety, maximum feasible dose and feasibility of      intravenously delivered allogeneic uc-MSCs in preterm infants at risk of developing BPD. This      will be a Phase 1, open-label, single center, dose-escalating trial using a 3+3+3 design.    ",,"

","      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been used in a variety of clinical applications to repair      and regenerate damaged tissue. Previous research has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of      delivering bone marrow cells including MSCs to chronic wounds with significant improvement in      healing and scarring. Application of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to severe burn      wounds represents an opportunity for improved outcomes where alternate therapies are limited      and often ineffective.      In this protocol, 2nd degree burn wounds will receive direct application of EVs derived from      bone marrow MSCs. We have observed success with this type of approach in the past using bone      marrow stem cells including MSCs. We have evidence that EVs derived from MSCs are responsible      for many of the healing effects produced by MSCs and may be a safer, more reliable      alternative to allogeneic cell therapy. This protocol is designed to develop a safe and ideal      method of administering bone marrow cell Extracellular Vesicles to wounds.    ","      The study is designed to examine the safety of administering EVs derived from allogeneic MSCs      to 2nd degree burn wounds of less than 20% TBSA. The study will consist of a single dose      level which will evaluate the safety of administering allogeneic Extracellular Vesicles-with      a total of 10 patients. The chosen dosage will correlate to a dose of MSCs administered under      another protocol (IND 14810). The dose level delivered will be EVs derived from approximately      1 X 104 MSCs for each cm2 treated area not to exceed 20% TBSA in total (cumulative, if more      than one area is treated). The limitation in wound sizes to be treated will not change      throughout the study. Up to 2 additional administrations of EVs will be given over a period      of no more than 8 weeks.

","      Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are rare severe cutaneous      adverse reactions (SCARs) to drugs.      To date, no curative drug has demonstrated with a good level of evidence its ability to      promote SJS and TEN healing and could contribute to earlier reepithelialisation. Mesenchymal      stroma cells (MSCs) therapy represents a new therapeutic approach. eg, in patients with      cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, renal transplantation, lung diseases as acute      respiratory distress syndrome.      Recently, MSCs have been proposed in both burn wound healing with a significantly decrease of      the unhealed burn area and in cutaneous radiation.      Moreover, MSCs have immunomodulation properties potentially effective in refractory acute and      chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) by improving thymic function and induction of Tregs.      Indeed, MSCs are able to migrate to inflamed tissues after stimulation by pro-inflammatory      cytokines and to modulate the local inflammatory reactions. MSCs have also demonstrated their      ability to promote tissue remodelling, angiogenesis and immunomodulation through either      differentiation or secretion of several growth factors such as VEGF, basic FGF and various      cytokines.      Therefore, combining their immunomodulation effect and secretion of soluble factors involved      in wound repair, MSCs might be valuable as a cell therapy strategy for promoting cutaneous      healing in SJS-TEN syndrome and subsequently decrease the morbi-mortality.

","      The clinical study with UMC119-06-05 is designed to investigate the safety in patients with      mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This will be a dose escalation, open label,      single-center study in adult with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis. UMC119-06-05 is ex      vivo cultured human umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells product which is      intended for treatment of knee osteoarthritis.    ","      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA), also known as degenerative joint disease, is the most common type      of arthritis diagnosed. KOA is typically the result of wear and tear and progressive loss of      articular cartilage. The prevalence of the Knee osteoarthritis will continue to increase as      life expectancy and obesity rises. Osteoarthritis is typically a progressive disease that may      eventually lead to disability. The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each      individual. However, they typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating      over time.The intensity of the clinical symptoms may vary from each individual. However, they      typically become more severe, more frequent, and more debilitating over time.      The rate of progression also varies for each individual. Common clinical symptoms include      knee pain that is gradual in onset and worse with activity, knee stiffness and swelling, pain      after prolonged sitting or resting, and pain that worsens over time. Treatment for knee      osteoarthritis begins with conservative methods and progresses to surgical treatment options      when conservative treatment fails. While medications can help slow the progression of RA and      other inflammatory conditions, no proven disease-modifying agents for the treatment of knee      osteoarthritis currently exist. Among the more innovative, experimental therapies,      mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are proposed as a novel therapy with potential in treatment      of KOA.    ",,"
